        <b>IntervalVibe</b> - the solution I created for interval timing. I can’t describe how proud I am of this app, and I am just truly excited to have it on the official app store. Having an app has been a goal of mine for a long time, and the hours that were put into, not just creating, but learning Swift, were well worth it. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intervalvibe/id6450401194">Here is a link to the app store if you are interested.</a> The app is entirely free, and there will never be any costs associated with it. With that, here is a high overview of the app and its functionality.

        The first thing that you will notice, on the homepage, is that the title is actually “IntervalVibe+”. I really wanted to have the “+” be in the title on the App Store, but it made the title exactly one character too long. With the “+” on the end, it shortens the name under the app to “IntervalV…”. This didn’t look clean, so I removed it. I left it in the app, though, just for my own personal preference. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The home screen is quite simple: “Quick Setup”, “Select / Start Intervals”, and “Interval Builder”. At the bottom there is a question mark to go into the help menu. Starting with “Quick Setup”:

        This was the original concept for the app, and in fact, I thought I would just create this and release it. Just enter the length of the interval, time between intervals (kind of like a rest period), the number of sets, and start. I found very quickly, this did not work for most of my workouts. But what it worked great for, is when I needed a quick interval for something like coding. I would set a timer for 50 minutes, with time between intervals at 10 minutes. I would put the number of sets to three, and then, I was ready to go. I could easily plan my breaks and know how long I had been sitting for. It was a great way to know that I should get up and take a break, and it also kept me focused, because I knew I hadn’t been sitting for too long.
        <br>

        Unfortunately, as I said above, it doesn’t work well for multiple items. I also wanted a way to display what I should be doing on the screen. For example, if I am doing push ups, it should say it.

        Thus the “Interval Builder” was born. There were quite a few iterations, and I am happy with how it turned out. It's very easy to use, and looks good. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The workflow is like this: 1. Give the timer a name to identify it in the selection screen. 2. Choose the amount of sets, or times it will repeat. 3. Add your activities with the “Add New Activity” button. That’s really it. When creating a new activity, you just give the activity a name (push ups, rest, study time, etc.), select an amount of time, and a color. The color is used as the background when it appears. The activities list is as “Apple-esque” as I could make it. Drag and drop to move the activities around, and swipe to delete. 
        <br>
        <br>
        At the top of the screen, there is a “Clear Page” button. It does what it sounds like, and it clears the page. At the bottom of the page are the “Load Timer” and “Save Timer” buttons. These also do what they sound like. Load in an existing timer to edit it, or save the current

    <br>

    <p id="JE_main_text">
        Once your timers have been created, jump over the “Select / Start Intervals”. Here you will find all the timers you created. Same as the other list, drag and drop and swipe to delete are available. There is also an “Edit” button if you would like to edit the page that way. 
        <br>
        <br>
	    Tap the timer you want to start, and a preview will appear. Below the preview is a “Start Timer” button. Tap to begin.

        Out of all of the elements of the app, this is what I am most proud of. I love the simple UI; I love how non distracting it is. You see your current activity, the amount of time remaining, the amount of sets remaining, and you see what the next activity will be. I also removed any buttons from the screen that may be distracting. If you want to pause or end early, tap anywhere on the screen to pause. From here you may exit or resume.
        <br>
        <br>
	    In the final seconds of each activity, there will be three consecutive “beeps”. This will alert you that it is almost time to switch, and it does not interfere with music or any other sounds coming from your device. It will simply just play the sounds over the device’s sounds. If you have your device turned off, the timer will continue to count down, and the “beeps” will also still sound. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, if you prefer to go landscape view, it is available. The time reamining will resize to take up more of the screen, which makes it easier to see at a distance.

	    Again, I couldn’t be happier with the app. It is very simple, and it does a very simple task. That’s the best kind of apps in my mind; those that just do what they are supposed to do. No ads, no subscriptions, no extra garbage. There is a time and place for these things (except maybe not the garbage), but not in apps like this. 
        <br>
        <br>
	    Thank you for taking the time to learn more about this project, and <a href="../JournalEntries/IntervalTimer+Journal.html">here is a link to my journal</a> where I (kind of) track my journey from no Swift knowledge to getting my app onto the App Store. You can find my contact info on my homepage if you have any other questions or concerns (or if you just straight up hate it, let me know). I have other app ideas I am ready to start, so onto the next!
