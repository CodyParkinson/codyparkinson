        I had such a nice time this morning that I thought I would write about what I will dub Packsaddle Lake Loop. Packsaddle lake is located directly west of the Tetons. You could potentially reach the trailhead by taking the road on the west side of the mountains, through Green Canyon. Instead of this route, I went around to the east side of the mountain, near Tetonia. The road is much better maintained on this side, and the snow and ice were not as deep. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Most people will drive the road to the official Packsaddle Lake trail and just walk the half mile or so to it. I parked right at the gate to the Caribou-Targhee National Forest boundary and ran the road to the trailhead. This is the first long segment of the trail. This part is up to you if you want to do the loop. I just did it to get some extra steps in. Once I reached the official trailhead, I took the trek down to the lake. A nice ice sheath covered the lake, but overall it was nice, quiet, and beautiful. I did have my hopes up here, because there was virtually no snow, and it was just cold enough to keep the ground frozen (no mud). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Coming back up the trail, I took a left and continued on the main road. This road cannot be missed as it is - the main road. It definitely got nice and icy as the road went on. Some brave souls had tried taking a vehicle through, and it looked like they may have had a fun time getting it turned around. On foot, not too bad. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Before I started running, I saw on Google Maps another road that cut from the main road back to Packsaddle Lake. As I was coming to my turn off, I decided to keep on going past for a quarter mile or so (I just completely ran past it). When I realized what I had done, I turned back. Eventually I found the beginning of the turn off “road”. This is what we call in the industry, not a road. At one point it looks like it was used for logging, but the forest service had come through and dug pits, laid trees, and covered the trail. The snow was only about ankle deep in some spots here, so I adventured on and just tried to make the most of what was left of the trail.

        Luckily, some deer had the same idea I had and created a nice game trail through the trees. Coming over the ridge, the view opened up, and the wet shoes became more than worth it. The top of the ridge overlooks the canyon where Packsaddle Lake resides, and the views of the Tetons are just spectacular. Today was supposed to be overcast and just kind of crummy, but the clouds had parted (must have known I was coming). 
        <br>
        <br>
        The rest of the trail was just a single track game trail along the ridgeline and back to the Packsaddle lake trail. Between all the animals, the lake, the weather, it was just a really good loop. Highly recommend if willing to bushwack a bit. The very best part was as I was coming down the hill towards where I parked, two red pine grosbeaks were sitting in a tree. The pictures I got are horribly blurry, but these were the first I have ever spotted.

        8 miles, two-ish hours, 1300 feet of ascent, what a nice way to start the fall break.
