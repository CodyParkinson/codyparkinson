    <p id="JE_main_text">I set my goal to see how much of Snow Canyon’s trails could feasibly be done in a day. This is most definitely not an optimized route, but I think it covers most of what people come to the canyon to see. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I parked at the Lava Tubes Trail parking, near the north entrance to the park. This section crosses over lava rock to the west. When I hit the junction for the White Rocks Trail, I followed it north, through pretty deep sand, to the Amphitheater. The natural bowl has a notch that overlooks the lower canyon; make sure to climb up and see it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Following the same trail down, I got back onto the Lava Tubes Trail. There are 4 tube entrances to stop at, but 2 of them have collapsed. The two uncollapsed tubes have signs, so you really can’t miss them. Be prepared for some moderately tough scrambling into the caves, especially the first uncollapsed one (bring a flashlight!).
    <br>
    <br>
    Continuing down the trail, I passed through the West Canyon Wash onto the road. You can continue north on this road for a few more miles, it is well graded, but I went south to connect to the Red Sands Trail. Be prepared when you hit this trail, it is deep, deep sand, and you will feel the burn. I do not necessarily recommend doing the full Red Sands Trail. It follows a small wash to a nice overlook, but I think the lookouts are much better if you just continue to Padre Canyon. Padre Canyon is difficult, and the trail can be easy to lose on the north side. If you don’t see footsteps, backtrack. I continued up to the top of the canyon, and the views were spectacular. On one side you overlook Padre, and the other overlooks Tuacahn.
    <br>
    <br>
    Following the trail down (it looks harder than it really is), there is a parking lot for the Tuacahn theater. This is where most people park when hiking the canyon, but there is a trail that loops around the point of the mountain back to the park entrance. Back at the southern entrance, I continued up on the paved trail for a bit (I think it's called Whipple or Whiplash or something like that). The sand dunes on this part of the trail are fun to stop at. I made sure to also stop and see the pioneer names on the cliffside (wow (sarcasm)). I turned off at Hidden Pinyon, which is just a pretty hike, and there are some great prickly pears to peak at. Hidden Pinyon leads to my favorite part of the canyon, the preserved, fossilized sand dunes. They are a beautiful vermillion with some unique lines cutting through. I hiked to the top of the sands to a small “arch”. This is a central view of the park, look north to the white rocks, south to red sands, west to the lava flow, and east to the cinder hills. From here, I just followed the trail down to Butterfly, which connects to the Lava Flow Trail, and back to the start. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It took me 9 hours to complete this loop, which totaled 15 miles. Elevation gain was only 2500 feet on the day, making this a relatively flat hike. Out of the 9 hours though, I was only moving for about 5.5 of them. You will want to take lots of stops to take it all in. Some final thoughts, make sure to pack water. Sounds dumb, but there is literally no place to fill up water, and its the desert - plan accordingly. Also, go in the early morning. No one was there when I entered, and some of these places, like the caves, can get crowded during the day. And yeah, that’s about it. Make sure to watch out for the scrub jays - they are extra pretty in Utah.
