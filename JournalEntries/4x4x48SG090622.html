        The expression, “it sounded like a good idea at the time,” rings true. This is my second time doing this workout, and oh boy, it was not any easier the second time around. It didn’t help that there is a heatwave here in St.George, so the temperature got as high as 110F on my afternoon runs. I am grateful for the amount of previous miles I have logged at high temperatures, because without them, I would not have finished. While I do not recommend training out in these temperatures, I would be remiss to say that I don’t think it helps. After you run in cook-an-egg-on-the-sidewalk temperatures, it is crazy how good you feel running in normal temps.
        <br>
        <br> 
        But this is not about heat training, this was about getting in some night running and sore miles in preparation for the Pony Express 100. I have about 5 weeks left before the race, and this is a great confidence booster. 
        <br>

        The last time I did this, I was living out of a van in Yuma. The temperatures were great, like mid 70 highs and 60 lows great. All of my runs were done in sub one hour, but I never had a time under 50 minutes. I took it slow, but I wrecked myself by the time I was done. It took quite a few days to recover.
        <br>
        <br>
        This time, I was in a little bit better shape, and I ended with no muscle cramps, fatigue, or soreness. The biggest hurdle was the fact that I could not drink enough to balance out the sweat loss, so the headaches were pretty severe, and on my second night my vision went out, but all in all pretty typical stuff. 
        <br>

        I am proud to finish another one of these. This workout really is pretty special, and I think most people would benefit from trying to accomplish it. There are multiple variations, but it is all great in getting your brain back on track. I’ve documented how I felt on each run, just so if you are interested, you’ll have some idea of what to expect ---
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
    
    Run 1 - 9/2/2022<br>
        4pm - 110F - Grandpa’s Pond - 39:52 <br>
    Went out strong, and had a great first run. The problem is, it is hard to remember what you’ll feel like in 48 hours, so I probably went out too fast. <br><br>
        
    Run 2 - 9/2/2022<br>
        8pm - 100F - Red Rock Conservation Area - 38:25 <br>
    Gotta love the red rocks, but seriously what was I thinking going this fast again? <br><br>
    
    Run 3 - 9/3/2022<br>
    12am - 86F - Hell Hole - 39:52 <br>
    Started to cool down, but I definitely started to feel the push in trying to sub 40 minutes. <br><br>
    
    Run 4 - 9/3/2022<br>
        4am - 80F - Hell Hole - 39:42 <br>
    I woke up feeling great. A bit of a push, but I felt on top of the world. <br><br>
    
    Run 5 - 9/3/2022<br>
        8am - 92F - Washington Parkway - 49:34 <br>
    How fast the top of the world comes crashing down. This was a hard, hard run. It felt like I hit the wall before I even started, and by the time I finished, I was still behind it.	<br><br>
    
    Run 6 - 9/3/2022<br>
        12pm - 96F - Virgin River Trail - 49:38 <br>
    I promised myself I would get Chick-Fil-A after this, so it was a pretty easy run. <br><br>
    
    Run 7 - 9/3/2022<br>
        4pm - 110F - Grandpa’s Pond - 48:45 <br>
    Took my time and had a great run, for the temperature. Can feel that the same amount of effort does not equal the same times. <br><br>
    
    Run 8 - 9/3/2022<br>
        8pm - 100F - Church Rocks - 58:33 <br>
    Very much miscalculated this run. I forgot about the major climb and steepness of the descent off of Grapevine, and it was a real push to break sub 1 hour. I would say this was the hardest run of the workout.  <br><br>
    
    Run 9 - 9/4/2022<br>
        12am - 85F - Telegraph Street - 58:48 <br>
    Decided to run a flat area to try and recoup some of the energy lost on the previous run. Felt good, did lots of walking. Vision gave out for a bit and went dark. I kept pushing and it came back after a few minutes. <br><br>
    
    Run 10 - 9/4/2022<br>
    4am - 80F - Telegraph Street - 59:36 <br>
    Same as the previous run, lots of walking. Got stopped by an officer for a few minutes, because there was someone running in and out of the road. It might have been me, I was pretty sleepy. <br><br>
    
    Run 11 - 9/4/2022<br>
        8am - 88F - Hell Hole - 47:32 <br>
    Felt rejuvenated. I got my electrolytes balanced, I had eaten, and I slept like a rock. It felt so close to the end, and I went out hard to make sure I finished strong. <br><br>
    
    Run 12 - 9/4/2022<br>
        12pm - 92F - Virgin River Trail - 49:39 <br>
    The thought of finishing was a real perk up. Paced well and finished strong. I was worried about soreness and fatigue, but I really felt like I could have kept going. I think that’s the craziest part about this workout is once you finish, you realize how much further you could keep going. It’s like you have already gone past what you thought would be “the hardest part” so everything just feels like it can’t get any worse than what you have already done. <br><br><br><br><br>
