    <p id="JE_main_text">	When you compare other Garmin, Strava, Alltrails, or any other trail data, you’ll see that my elevation and distance was quite a bit more than the usual routes. The Oak Grove road is closed right above The Kiln. This means it is an extra 4.2 miles and approximately 1200’ elevation gain to the start of the Signal Peak Trailhead. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I recommend not listening to the negative comments on this trail when it comes to its beauty. The fire of 2021 did leave a scar on the area, but many of the pines survived, and once you are on top, there is no visible scar. The southeastern side of the mountain is exposed and does require steep, rocky switchbacks.
    <br>
    <br>
    To anyone looking to summit, do not follow the ridgeline. The trail can be hard to see at first, but once you come to the top of the cliff face, continue down the otherside of the mountain into the valley. Following the ridgeline will take you to a lower peak that you will have to backtrack through. This is what I did, which added more elevation, distance, and time. Follow the further water trail through to the meadows. There is no trail to Signal Peak, so there is some bushwhacking involved.

    The summit of Signal Peak is anticlimactic. It’s a flat rocky area with no real view. Make sure to walk southwest of the peak to a small clearing with a decent view of Veyo and Snow Canyon. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This trail is pretty well maintained, and I recommend it if you are willing to put in the extra 8.4 miles roundtrip to get to the trailhead. I would suspect the road will reopen sometime in April, but the snow does make it difficult that early in the year. The road closed June 22nd due to fire danger, so not very much time to get to Oak Grove. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If you want to summit but don’t want to do the extra walking, take the Brown’s Point trail in Pine Valley. Just make sure to also summit Burger Peak at the same time; the views shouldn’t be missed. </p>
