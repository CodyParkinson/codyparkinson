        The following is a journal I created to keep track of my progress in learning the Swift language and creating my first IOS app. I have left everything just how I originally wrote it.
    </p>

        I am sick of not having an app that I can set multiple timers in. You would think that there would be a bunch of apps that include this feature. I want an app that can do two things: 1. Be able to set multiple, simultaneous timers. 2. Be able to start a new timer once a timer has ended. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For 1, did you know that the standard clock app on iPhone doesn’t have the feature to set multiple timers? What a dumb thing to not include. There are many times, when you are cooking for example, that you have multiple timers going. I like to wander around while I wait for things to finish, so I much prefer having a timer on my phone than on the oven. Plus, the oven only has one timer, so if I have two things baking, what am I to do? 
        <br>
        <br>
        For 2, I like to do circuit workouts. I would like a timer to restart once it has finished. In this, I also want there to be a cool down timer. For instance, I want a five minute timer to go 3 times with a one minute timer between all of them. I also want it to alert when there is 10 seconds left on each timer (or some other time left). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, it isn’t that these apps don't exist, because they do. But, I cannot find one that has both of these features and is free. I am so cheap that I am going to learn how to code Swift, just to make this app “free”. I know I could just spend like $3 and get an app for both of these, but that isn’t fun. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This Journal is just a diary of everything that it took to go from zero Swift experience to an app on the App Store. I just got XCode downloaded, and I am watching the Stanford Lectures to try and teach myself the language. Today I finished the first two lectures, and I will be moving on to the assignments and readings in the next couple days. I figure if I can do the lectures almost like they are taught at Stanford, I can get it done within 5 or so weeks. Then I figure I can write the app in 2 weeks. Give myself an extra week and another extra week to get Apple to approve the app. This puts the final goal at nine weeks away or June 1st.

        I forgot that I needed to head out of state for a few days, but I am back now and ready to continue on. While off, I downloaded an app called ‘Unwrap’. It doesn’t really seem to get into UI design, but it does go through Swift coding exercises. So far, swift kinda just looks like another Python, which is really good news.
        <br>
        <br>
        I did just finish lecture 3 of the Stanford lectures, and oh boy did it ramp up really fast. It went from, “how is this so easy?” to, “this is crazy.” I also watched some other Youtube videos trying to figure out some of the concepts, and I read documentation. The problem, like every other programming language, is there are a bunch of opinions on how to do the same things. People use the word “standard” and then do something completely unstandard to how the last person did it. I wouldn’t say I am overwhelmed, but my brain is fried for the day. I had enough energy left to start a project for my app. I decided to call it “Adequate Timer”. I also did some super rough sketches to start deciding how I want my app to look (please don’t laugh at my drawing and spelling abilities).

        I thought about it today, and I decided that I needed to add another way of learning Swift. I am going to continue on with the Stanford lectures, but I am supplementing some of the concepts with the 100 days of SwiftUI at the Hacking with Swift website. I like how it is laid out there. The Stanford lectures are crazy good, but I am not crazy good. There are a couple concepts that are run over very fast, which is fine, they expect those students to already have some grasp of these concepts. I am starting at a lower level, so I need the extra help.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was able to work through the first four days of the 100 day course. I feel pretty confident with most of the basic Swift concepts (especially since so much of it looks like JavaScript and Python). What I really need is help with the UI. I just don’t have the brain yet to figure out how or where to start. I did attempt to start building the front page of the App today, and it does look pretty… bad. But, I learned a lot today, and I am excited for the coming challenges!

	    Just a short update, but I completed “day 14” of the 100 days. Definitely some of those last concepts are a little jarring, but nothing too bad or different than other languages. Day 15 is just a review, and after that, it is actual UI design and creation. Hopefully by the end of next week, I can create at least a very basic version of the app I want to make. I think the goal will be to have a countdown timer behind a navigation page that can be turned on and off. 
    </p>

	    Some highly productive days. I had one of those ah-ha moments, and a lot of the concepts and functionality of Swift clicked. I just finished day 22 of the 100 days of Swift, and there really are some very useful examples in the projects. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I spent a good portion of my learning time today working on my app. The very basic functionality is there. You can input a time and start a countdown. Once it reaches 0, it’s done. Things that I have not done yet are: 1. Loop through the number of sets the user wants. 2. Have a rest time between the sets. 3. Put the timer on a different screen. I have some ideas on how to implement them, but there are some concepts of Swift that are still getting in the way. I am still learning how to use Views properly, but like I said above, it is starting to come much faster. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope by the end of tomorrow to finish up days 23 and 24. After this, I plan to build some functions into the interval app to at least make it a one screen, interval timer. I think today marks two weeks since I have started learning, so I had better pick up the pace!
    </p>

        It has been quite a few days since I have written an update, but this is not for a lack of progress. I have finished up to day 40 of the 100 days, but I have been spending extra time working on the timer. And it works! (mmm kind of). It works in the sense that it does exactly what I want it to do, but it is very basic and needs quite a few more things. The code for it is… something to be desired. I have written all of it in one view, and I just use an if/else statement to clear the screen. Ultimately I think it should be written in multiple views, but for now it works!
        <br>
        <br>
        I am having a hard time understanding how to share data between views, and I need to work on really understanding the difference between classes and structs. The key to what I am looking for, I believe, lies in that understanding. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Oh, but I almost forgot, I got the app to run on my phone! So, that is a very large step forward. I’ll attach some photos of the app below. But, what the goals are next - 1. I want to make it *beep* when there are three seconds left of each timer. So, there will be a queue that the timer is about to switch to the rest or back into the interval. 2. I want a page to appear when the timer is done that just basically says, “DONE”, and maybe I’ll even add a different sound to this one. Taylor recommends I add a puppy running on the screen while the timer is going. I’ll see what I can do about that. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Other than that, May is rapidly approaching. I am very happy with what I have produced so far, and I am really enjoying SwiftUI. I have even started using ChatGPT to help build the framework of some other ideas, but I need to stay focused on finishing my timer app.

        Hectic few days, and I am going to be out of town (hiking the Canyonlands), for the next few, and I start a new job on Monday, so be patient for the next update :).

        Yup, still really haven’t touched, woah can life blow up fast! But, I have been using the UnWrap app to keep my brain thinking about Swift.

        I am so excited by the amount of progress that I have made in the last few days! I think I finally really figured out the hype of ChatGPT. The trick really is to learn how to ask very specific questions. I now feel like I have enough knowledge of Swift to really leverage AI. I have now played around a lot with ChatGPT, but I cannot get it to write very “good” code, at least not code that works within my app. But, what it does do is build really good templates to work from. This is my advice to others just learning a language, let ChatGPT do all the really dumb stuff.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, I wanted to build a ‘Tips’ page. I asked chatGPT to write me a generic SwiftUI help page, and boom, instantly done. What would have taken me probably a few hours to Google and figure out was done in just a few seconds. I could then look over the code and figure it out from there. Any errors that popped up are an easy search away, heck if you just ask ChatGPT, it can sometimes figure out its own mistake! 
        <br>
        <br>
        It may sound like cheating, but I feel like I am picking up the language very fast. I can look at what was written and work backwards through it. If you have no knowledge of the language, it will be very difficult to work with what ChatGPT spits out. It has made me even more excited to go and learn new topics. I’ll ask for an idea on how to do something, and it will give me multiple ways of trying the problem. This has led me down lots of rabbit holes, and now I feel like I have really practical Swift knowledge. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I hate when I’m trying to learn something and I can’t quite see if I am going down the right path. You can learn so much lingo and tricks, but most of the time, you will never use it. It’s more just ‘gee-wiz’ info. But, by learning by building, and with the aid of ChatGPT, you can very easily see the practicality, because it is part of the foundation of how the app actually functions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Well that’s my rant about my process, here’s some updates on the app itself! Firstly, well everything is pretty much different, new looks, new pages, everythings. I locked it to dark mode, because I don’t want to worry about writing and making the colors look good for light mode. Everyone should be using dark mode anyway. My original interval code is under “Quick Setup”. This is for those who just want a simple timer that goes: Time, Rest, Time, Rest, etc. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I added an interval builder. Here the user can create any kind of interval timer they want!
        <br>
        <br>
        Next is the selection screen. Simply tap to see the details of the created Interval and press start! Once the timer starts, it looks just like my example above, but the background dynamically changes to the user’s color input. Also, it displays the next timer! 
        <br>
        <br>
        And, that’s about it! I have a list of things to edit, and I am still working on usability. Give me a couple more days, and I think I’ll be shipping it out to the Apple Store!

        Oh my goodness. I am not consistent - this should have been shipped out by now… I have been procrastinating and doing other things. I keep thinking I need to sit down and finish this thing out, but I keep getting myself involved in other projects. This is my promise to myself: this app will be pushed to Apple today! *Later this day* - Okay, so I am dumb and I didn’t realize that I also have to verify my identity with my developer account, but good news! I am just waiting now to push, the app is done! So here is what I am going to do, <a href="../JournalEntries/IntervalVibe+Overview.html">I am going to create another page with a link HERE</a>. This will be a complete breakdown of the app and how it functions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some final notes and thoughts: I did an absolutely terrible job updating this journal. There were a lot of days in which I worked on this, but I didn’t write anything. It definitely would have been nice to just at least write a small paragraph each day with an update, but oh well. I have somewhat thought about how much time I have invested into this first app, and it is a lot to say the least. I bet I have 100 hours in just this app. This doesn’t just mean working on the app, I also am including all the time it has taken me to learn the basics of the language. I still plan on finishing the 100 days of Swift, but I really have liked my new way of learning. 
        <br>
        <br>
        If this process has taught me anything, it is the potential power of AI. Even on my really small scale, I learned so much so quickly. I could ask ChatGPT questions about why the code wasn’t working and it would give me feedback immediately. Instead of looking at indirect examples on Stack Overflow or other sights, I was able to get feedback on my exact problem. This helped me move on quickly to the next problem, and it made the process, really, a lot more fun. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I really enjoy working with SwiftUI, because you can see the fruits of your labor almost immediately. It is so fun to see the preview of your code in XCode, and it makes debugging and design just so fast and efficient. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This journal is an absolute ramble, and I don’t even know if I created the app that I intended to! I was also supposed to create a way to set multiple timers within the app. I completely skipped over that and just created an interval timer. But, I am completely happy with how the app turned out, and I plan on just updating it to fix bugs. I will not be adding any more to it. I was listening to Rick Rubin, and what he said really kind of inspired me to really wrap this up and move on. He talked about how you are successful once you put your work out there for others to see. The work will never be perfect, by definition it just can never be. There are so many projects that we want to see get done, but in order to move onto those, we have to be willing to let go of the ones we are currently working on. I am ready to let this one go. Like I said, I am so happy with where it is at, and I sincerely hope others find it useful. This app will be completely free forever, and man, at the end of the day, I just like building stuff and figuring problems out. So this whole thing is a win win.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whelp this ramble is done. My punctuation is horrible in this and I probably missed a bunch of words, but I have just been typing nonstop my thoughts. I promise the app's about page will be better. On to the next project! (Also the new name of the app is IntervalVibe+) Here is also a final look at some of the thoughts I went through on paper.
