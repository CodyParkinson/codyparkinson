    I am Cody Parkinson. This site is hopefully a reflection of what I am about, and a record of personal accomplishments and thoughts. I hate to call it a blog, but if it looks like a duck and quacks like one, well you know the rest. <br><br>
	If you are interested in knowing my working history, please click the link to my CV or Linkedin. If you want to see sporadic pictures of nature, head over to my Instagram. If you are just looking for a quick about, here it is: <br> <br>
	I grew up in Rexburg, Idaho, but I graduated from Rigby High, just a town over. I went on to Utah State University where I received my B.S. in biochemistry with a minor in biology. I just so happened to graduate in spring 2020, which we all know what happened at that time. I ended up moving back to Rigby for a bit where my wife and I built out a van. We made the decision to spend the following winter in Yuma, Arizona, and we could not have made a better choice. <br><br>
	My wife found the Dixie University nursing program, so after our time in Arizona, we moved to St.George, Utah. This is where we are currently at, my wife will be finishing school soon, and now we are settling into our careers and life. <br><br>
	I like to think I am a runner, but a runner is someone who generally “runs”, I am more of a fast hiker. I also like to think I am a programmer, but really, I just like solving online math problems. But, if you are interested in anything you see on the site, please feel free to reach out. I am always looking for others who share the same passions, and I would love to hear your criticisms on why you think TempleOS is the superior operating system. Email is always open: codyparkinson22@gmail.com
