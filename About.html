    Hello, I am Cody Parkinson. I was originally hoping that I wasn’t making a blog, but it seems to be that this is what it has become. If you are interested in knowing my school and work history, please click the link to my CV or Linkedin. My email is codyparkinson22@gmail.com, and this is the best way to reach me.

    If you are not interested in those things, then I have no idea how you found this site. Because here is what stinks, when you Google “Cody Parkinson”, you get results for Colby Parkinson. This guy plays on the Seahawks, and I will say, his Instagram is pretty cool (maybe you should go check him out too). But also, why did you Google my name? That is the real question. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I digress, this is an about page, and the only way you got to this page was by clicking around on the main site. You were interested enough to click on “About” to know something about me. Sorry though, I ain’t putting any juicy details on this page. Go to another page, like the birding one, that is where the real juice is. I also have some juicy fruits in my “Book Club”. Go look at those instead. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Considering you are still reading, I appreciate you taking the time to look through my site. Like I said above, the best way to reach me is by email, and I sincerely hope you like my blurry photos of birds (seriously go look at my birding page).
    </p>
