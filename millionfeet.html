        <h3 id="mil_QA_sub" style="padding-top:2rem;">Q&A's</h3>

        <h4 class="mil_Qs">Why are all of your numbers so clean? Seems fishy to always land on a multiple of 10.</h4>
        <p class="mil_As">Due to the nature of altimeters and watches, it can be difficult to get a 100% accurate reading. There are 2 major ways to calculate elevation gain. First is the altimeter in the watch. This can be affected by high pressure systems, weather, or just getting something lodged into the sensor. The second way is tracking your gps route, using a known elevation map, and calculating the change from point to point. This is great if you always have a good GPS signal. Unfortunately, rocks, trees, mountains, buildings, and everything else can cut the signal. So, points may not be accurate. With these thoughts in mind, I have decided to use the altimeter and account for variations. To do this I always round down the elevation gain 5-10%. The longer the route the less I will take off percentage wise due to better averaging. It’s not an exact science or rule, but I think it should work fine. I will throw out any days that the elevation doesn’t make sense. I have an okay idea of what elevation I have done most days, so I will also use this as a general guide. </p>

        <h4 class="mil_Qs">How do you track your elevation?</h4>
        <p class="mil_As">I am currently using a Garmin Instinct. I like this watch a lot, and I believe it to be accurate. I have run loops of known distance and elevation, and it has almost always come in at +-1%. The few problems I have encountered have been very, very easy to tell that it is incorrect. Like, it will say I climbed 2000 feet in one mile. This is usually because I get sunscreen in the altimeter hole, so kinda on me. Once cleaned, it runs accurately again. </p>

        <h4 class="mil_Qs">You sure aren’t doing very many feet daily. Isn’t this going to take you years at this pace?</h4>
        <p class="mil_As">As of today (July 21st, 2022), I am trying to figure out the best way to approach this without burning myself out. I live in an amazing area, here in Southern Utah, and there are plenty of things to climb. It was 110F today, so right now it is difficult to get motivated to climb after work, so I just run the canyon next to my home in the mornings. The goal is to do this in under 2 years. 2 years = 730 days = 1369’ per day. This should be pretty easy to complete (as long as I don’t take too many rest days).</p>

        <h4 class="mil_Qs">1,000,000 feet doesn’t seem like that much?</h4>
        <p class="mil_As">Well when you think about it, it really isn’t that much. I mean the International Space Station sits at something like 250 miles (1.3 million feet) above earth, so I won’t even be making it there. But, I will not cry at this thought.</p>

        <h4 class="mil_Qs">Aren't there more effective ways of training? </h4>
        <p class="mil_As">I am not too worried about training for anything in particular. I just like climbing things.</p>

        <h4 class="mil_Qs">Why are you bald?</h4>
        <p class="mil_As">Bad genes I guess.</p>
