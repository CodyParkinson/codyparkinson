            After completing a semester of school, it can be difficult to gauge just home much you have learned. You can get A’s in everything, but how can you know if you actually ‘know’ it? This book took away all of my doubt, and I could not recommend it enough to those interested in what it takes to run a nuclear reactor (pressurized water reactor (PWR) to be precise).
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>How to Drive a Nuclear Reactor</i>, is an overview of the engineering, physics, and chemistry that goes into creating power from glowing rocks. There are about 450 operating nuclear power reactors worldwide, most being PWRs, so this is the focus of the book. The book is funny, witty, and just very easy to follow. Of course there is a lot of ‘slang’ and acronyms within the nuclear world, but Colin Tucker describes each one thoroughly and often restates what they were if it had been a few chapters since the term was introduced. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This next part I am about to write is a big ole pat on the back to myself, so if you don’t want to read the following narcissism, stop here. But, the classes I finished last semester were Nuclear Engineering Basics, Nuclear and Energy Systems, and Reliability and Risk Assessment. I am going to have a page describing each of these classes and what I learned in my journal entries, so go there if interested in what those classes entailed. Here, I am going to relate these classes to the book:
            <br>
            <br>
            Nuclear Engineering Basics: this class is the fundamentals of how we take an atom and get energy out of it. The first sections of this book talk about physics including cross sections, thermalization of neutrons, and decay pathways. This was the whole point of the class; how do we take an atom, like Uranium, and get it to fission? As I read I couldn’t help but be amazed how I could describe these processes and that I really feel I have an understanding of them. Albeit, I am currently enrolled in Reactor Physics, so I still have lots to learn about geometries and transport theory, I feel as of right now I am solid in my nuclear basics.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nuclear and Energy Systems: I loved this class. I would consider this my pathway into an understanding of thermodynamics and engineering design. Every day I learned something new, and this was the bulk of this book. When you look at the design of an energy plant, whether it be coal, gas, nuclear, there are key structures you need: a power source (Qin), turbine (Wout), cooler (Qout), and a compressor (Win). This is a very simplistic view, but it holds for a continuously cycled PWR. This is just how you generate power to the grid, and each of these can be broken down into thousands of subcomponents. For example, in a nuclear power plant, your power source is the reactor vessel. This requires a vast amount of components. Considering this is a PWR and not a boiling water reactor (BWR), the reactor core has its own coolant water circulating. This coolant water must transfer its heat to another system containing water (steam generator). The coolant water and steam water cannot be allowed to mix. And on and on and on.
            <br>
            <br>
            Reliability and Risk Assessment: So you have these thousands of different pieces, systems, and components. What if one breaks? What if you have a loss of coolant? We must have systems in place to ensure we do not have a meltdown. In the book it is described that all PWRs must be able to withstand a large break, double guillotine, LOCA. This is exactly what was taught in the course. To counteract this we must have an emergency core coolant system. This system needs to be diverse, duplicated, and physically separated. In most plants, there are four backups. For example, a plant would have four backup diesel generators. This allows one to be down for maintenance, one to fail unexpectedly, and two to run (only one is needed, so if two happen to break you’re still okay). This is the only point of complaint in the book. Colin Tucker states that plants must be able to handle ‘Credible events’, this is a deterministic design, and it is ineffective. I believe in fault tree analysis or chain of events. It is the idea that small events are what lead to large events (see Three Mile Island). Looking to Wash-1400, it states that deterministic design is not all encompassing; there are many more factors which need to be considered than just ‘credible’ events. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is my hopefully not too long report of the book, me just describing how smart I feel. Jokes aside, this is an excellent book. I have loved every minute of my degree thus far, and this book only helped to strengthen that love further. Wish me luck.

            <p> 
            It has been a minute since I finished a book. The last few months have been pretty hectic with school, so it was nice to take a bit and read a fun book over the Thanksgiving holiday. I’ve been thinking about reading this book for a while now, and I don’t know what happened but I’ve had this urge to revisit old MTV shows. I rewatched a couple episodes of <i>Rob and Big</i>, <i>Rob Dyradek’s Fantasy factory</i>, <i>Teen Mom</i>, <i>Cribs</i>, <i>Jersey Shore</i>, <i>Wildboyz</i>, and of course <i>Jackass</i>. Over the course of a few hours, I had this hit of nostalgia. Growing up it was cool to be a part of the skateboarding crew and wear Plan B t-shirts; I remember watching the <i>Art of Flight</i> over and over and drinking the old flavor of Rockstar mango (the new one doesn’t compare to how it used to taste). I don’t think really anyone can pinpoint the day when they just sort of stopped doing something, and this is how I think about this time. I don’t know what happened, but I just sort of stopped being into those things and became interested in other hobbies. What I do know is the transition was into programming and computers, so quite a leap. 
            <br>
            <br>
            What has never left me, was the crazy stunts of MTV and especially one star: Steve-O. This guy’s stunts are etched on my brain. I ended up rewatching the first two movies, and it just blows me away the things he was willing to do (which is a major theme of the book). I have listened to quite a few of his podcasts with guests that I was interested in like Nyjah Houston, Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, and just other crazy folk. This all led me to the penultimate decision to finally just read his book. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Two things I love about this book, first, I just love a good autobiography. Second, it's fun to read about someone’s life that I will just never live (nor have the desire to). Steve-O grew up as a ‘corporate brat’. Like a military brat, but with more money and a father in big business. He spent most of his childhood living in Europe and moved to Florida to attend university. As you can imagine from his later years, he did not do so well academically. In fact, I think he said he ended up with a 0.7 GPA overall (although one semester when he did apply himself he did get something like a 3.0). From here the story is he moved around some more, had some odd jobs, went to Barnum and Bailey Clown College (which is statistically harder to get into than Harvard), and eventually became a famous movie star. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Probably not the best summary of his life, but I’m not so interested in just giving a summary of the book. What I am interested in is more of the life he lived off camera and how he justified his lifestyle. Early on in the book he discusses his mother’s alcoholism and how hidden it was from his father. He and his sister would watch their mom succumb to this deep depression and self soothing through alcohol, but when their father was home from a business trip she was able to snap herself out of it. She would clean herself up and pretend nothing had happened. I thought about this a lot while reading. This is how Steve-O seemed to live his life. If he got loaded on drugs or alcohol, as long as he was able to portray himself as ‘okay’, that was all that mattered. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Eventually his mother and father split up, and she ended up with major health complications. She needed round the clock care, and it ultimately became Steve-O’s sister’s job to care for her. He states that he couldn’t really even look at her; it just made him feel too bad. So, he left, and he justified his leaving by wanting to make his mom proud and becoming successful. Ultimately towards the end of his drug use days, he talks about how he never took the time to let go of this goal or let go of his mother’s eventual passing, and this led to thoughts of self-harm and other problems. While reading, you get this sense that Steve-O is the most dedicated person alive. There is no one else willing to put their body at risk like he was willing to. There is a very genuine feel to the book. I have no doubt that he was as dedicated to fulfilling his promise of being a successful stuntman. Sounds like a cliche, but he really did live his life, in this really messed up way, for others, especially his mom. I think without even realizing it, he decided to show his respects to his mom the only way he knew how. He knew he couldn’t take care of her physically, which call it selfish to leave it all up to his sister, but that is how his brain handled it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Steve-O did become sober in 2008, and he published this book in 2011. It is unfathomable with the amount of drugs, alcohol, partying, stunts, and everything else that he is in as good of shape as he is. Since 2011, from listening to his podcast, it sounds like he is still doing well and is 15 years sober. In this silly way, it was sad to read this book. When I was young, I was very naive. I didn’t understand drugs. I thought Steve-O and the crew did the stunts just because they loved doing it. In part, this is probably somewhat truthful, but once you read about how the network paid them nearly nothing and the rampant drug use, it doesn’t have the same charm. Yeah dude, what an interesting guy. Well, back to school and getting through finals.

            <p>08/05/2023</p>
            <p> 
            I have never seen the movie, so I decided I better read the book before I do. I like to think of myself as a Jack Nicholson fan, and Taylor tells me <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</i> is definitely one of his best movies. So, I picked up the book and just read it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh boy, did it deliver. This is very cliche and sounds like a bad newspaper review, but it was thought provoking and absolutely captivating. You move around this very small world that is confined to a mental asylum, from the view of a Native American from the Dalles in Oregon. For most of the book Chief, the Native American, doesn’t talk, so it is like reading a third person account. Everyone thinks he is deaf and dumb, so he gets to see and hear everything. No one questions having in the room sweeping while they discuss confidential material. As the book progresses, there is this crescendo where he finally breaks and starts talking. The book then shifts to this first person view as the chief takes back his personal sovereignty.
            <br>
            <br>
            The thing is though, the book is not about the Chief. It is about McMurphy (Jack Nicholson in the movie). This absolute breakout force that tries to change the way the asylum is run. This battle ensues around Nurse Ratched and McMurphy, and that is ultimately the story of the book. McMurphy is this larger than life, pseudo cowboy that can’t be confined by rules; Nurse Ratched is an army nurse who runs the unit like clockwork. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Without spoiling too much, you could say that neither of them win. Both of them strip each other of their identity. But, I would like to make an argument that I haven’t been able to find anything on. If you look up what others write about the book, you will find things about how the book addresses racism, sexism, disability, shame, and on and on. These are most definitely present, and they all deserve their own papers. I don’t have the time to do that, nor the want. What I am most interested in is this sad reality of how this was just the way it was done. Right or wrong, I could believe that those working, nurses, orderlies, the doctor, were doing their very best. They were not rooting for electroshock therapy because they were sadistic, but they ultimately thought this was for their, the patient’s, best. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This makes the viewpoint of the Chief a very interesting aspect of this book. He was self admitted to the hospital, and in the end was able to check himself out. This begs the question then, can we rely on this perspective? Clearly he was not blind and dumb, and there is explanation in the book about how this came to be through his childhood. This, in my mind though, was not enough of an explanation to keep this act up for a decade. I have to wonder whether or not he really did have a mental disability. The way he described the ward being covered in a fog, the mechanisms in the walls, the robotic ways of people, I would believe that he needs help.
            <br>
            <br>
            This leads into my argument about the perception of the Chief and that of the whole book. Can we trust him? He most definitely has a right to be frustrated and upset by those around him. He was cast from his home by white people wanting to build a dam on the river, and not until he was on the ward did he really have experiences with people of other races. He very easily could have projected his frustration onto these people, even though they had nothing to do with the changing of his homeland. Add all of this on top of his paranoia, and I would call this an altered perception. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This all makes me wonder, were the orderlies that rough with the patient’s? Was Nurse Ratched that mean spirited of a lady; a lady who was ready to bulldoze anyone who got in her way? Was the doctor this dumb, pushover of a man? I don’t know. I think about the time period, the 1950’s. Lobotomies were seen as a miracle of science, the first waves of psychoactive drugs were coming through, electroshock therapy was in use; these things were not used as torture. They were used because this is what was available. In hindsight, we can look back and say it was wrong, but we could make that argument for a lot of things. I have this thought about what I would be thinking if I was a nurse ,and I was taking care of McMurphy. McMurphy was a true disturbance. He repeatedly broke ward policies, and he just seemed to be irate. He would threaten staff, and his threats seemed credible given his actions. I would be thinking, how could we help him become better?
            <br>
            <br>
            McMurphy builds this relationship with people in the ward, and he gets them to turn on the nurses and orderlies. Nowhere in the book is he described as not being a conman. In fact, he is repeatedly referred to as such. He uses people and substances for his gain. His past is checked, and from this view, I definitely do not view him as a hero of the ward. Someone who comes in and shakes things up for the better. Even in the end of the book, you see this destruction he leaves in his wake. McMurhpy does help a few of the patient’s ‘escape’, but it really isn’t escape. The only one who you feel like has a chance is Chief Bromden, but you have to ask yourself whether or not his freedom was worth the death and destruction of so many others. This could also lead into a whole other argument about that, but I digress.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yeah, I like writing after finishing a book, because it just helps get my thoughts sorted out. I really loved this book, but I feel quite torn about it. Good news is, I can finally go watch the movie.

            <p> 
            This book kind of came out of nowhere for me. I was perusing the YouTube when I saw that <i>The Minimalists</i> had posted their documentary on there. I had this faint recollection of watching it when it first came out, like maybe six-ish years ago. I am always fascinated by niche cultures like this one, and after watching the documentary again, I decided to look into their books. They have written quite a few, so I just kind of picked one at random, and it just happened to be <i>Everything That Remains</i>. I do not know where this book falls in their storyline, but it was short. So I thought, why not? 
            <br>
            <br>
            I think the way I think about life is not different from most people. Some days you think a very basic, minimalist lifestyle is the key to happiness, and other days, you think opulence is the key to happiness. This is something that I have thought about quite a bit, and I can never quite decide which one is better. What I usually come back to is, maybe it’s somewhere in the middle.
            <br>
            <br>
            This book is a memoir, so mostly just the history of how Joshua and Ryan become <i>The Minimalists</i>. The very brief synopsis is, they both worked in the corporate world until their late twenties when they realized that something was wrong. They were working too much, their relationships were failing, they had too much debt, and they were just overall unhappy. Josh met a world traveler who lived out a duffle bag, and he decided instead of world traveling, he was just going to learn how to live with less. His thought process was, if this guy could live out of a duffle bag, he could easily pair down his belongings to a more manageable amount. He got his friend Ryan in on his plan, and the rest is history. This is a very important point, because I do believe it does “normalize” them a bit. They aren’t these monks who only own a pair of sandals and a robe; they were, and still are, just people.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sprinkled between the history are the lessons they learned along the way, so I am just going to summarize some of the ideas that stuck out to me. The first one is a longer quote, but one that I really enjoy, “I’ve always claimed that my priorities are grandly important activities like spending time with family or exercising or carving out enough alone time to write. But they’re not. Until I actually put these pursuits first, until I make these undertakings part of my everyday routine, they are not my actual priorities.”I reread this a few times, and I just kind of shook my head at it. I hate to say it, but I really felt this one hit home. How many times do I say something is important to me, but yet, I waste time instead of actively pursuing it? Without getting too deep into my personal examples, I just think this is something I need to work on. Really check myself. Why am I wasting time on things I don’t like doing, things that do not bring me happiness, when I could be pursuing things that bring passion to my life? I don’t know, but I am looking to find out and make the necessary adjustments. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Chapter five, “Strong Moves Slow”, hits the point hard about the shifting of the mindset to every possession should serve a purpose. What I like most about this idea, though, is it is not only about our physical items. Does the food you eat serve you? Do your relationships? Your work? If not, they should be cut out. This is the biggest misconception about these guys, and I felt that reading any of their books is very important before committing to the “minimalist” lifestyle. Everyone thinks minimalism is about throwing out all of your possessions and only owning a shirt, a pair of pants, toothbrush, one fork, one spoon, and one plate. Now some people do this of course, but this isn’t their point. They advocate separating yourself from things with no value. If you love art, they want you to collect and maintain the art you love. This does not mean going to T.J. Maxx and buying a bunch of art just because your walls are bare. Buy art you love; curate with passion. I think we all know what this means. People get upset and throw out all of their sentimental items thinking that that is true minimalism. Don’t do this. There may be a time in which you are ready to relinquish some of these items, but if they bring you joy you don’t have to detach from them. I’ll take a page from Marie Kondo: if it does not spark joy, it does not belong in your life. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a small note from the next chapter, “The Sound of Minimalism”, about the dreaded “just in case”. We don’t get rid of things “just in case” we might need it later. But if you haven't worn that shirt or read that book in two years, are you really going to miss it? If you read <i>The Psychology of Money</i>, you would have read Morgan Housel's thoughts on everything having a cost. Even the items that are just laying around. Just a small thought.
            <br>
            <br>
            Towards the end of the book, there were some ideas that felt strangely “Goggins-esque”. In a definitely less harsh tone, Joshua describes his life without goals. How is this like Goggins at all? Isn’t Goggins the master of reaching his goals? I believe if you sat both of them down in a room together and had them discuss the matter of goals, they would say the same thing: perform without purpose. I believe they would both agree that life is chaotic to be rigid. You have to train yourself to be ready for whatever happens to come your way. It isn’t about goals, it is about putting in the work everyday and trying to be better. Without goals, though, if you don’t happen to finish what you were doing you aren’t sad about it; you know you were better than when you started and you move on. Here is an example, if Joshua was writing a book and ended up scraping it, he didn’t get depressed or put himself down. The book was not a goal. He just wanted to be a better writer, and he became a better writer by putting in the time daily. For Goggins, it isn’t about training for races or events, that isn’t the goal. He just wants to be the best possible person. Now you could argue that being a better writer or a better person are goals, but I see it as more abstract. When I think of goals, I think of hard numbers, places, things. I want to hit this marker, in this place, at this time, and get this thing. Their ideas have no end, they can’t end. You can never “finish” writing. You can never “finish” being a better person. You can only keep putting in work.
            <br>
            <br>
            The last idea I wrote down comes from this quote, “What you’re imagining is a meaningful life. Not a perfect life, not even an easy life, but a simple one.” Choose your hard. Living a simple life may not be easy, but I think it can be meaningful. Choosing a career that ignites passion, giving up things in order to have time to spend with others, downsizing to minimize debts, these things are hard and intimidating. But even if hard, I believe the otherside can bring immense satisfaction.

            Kind of crazy, I didn’t think I had this much to say about this book. It is only about 200ish pages, so very short. With all of this said, I have one major critique of this book; they use too many big words. It is like reading a thesaurus. I don’t think they ever reuse an adjective or verb in this whole book. I mean they use the word <i>uxorious</i>. Do you know what that means? I definitely did not. I guess if this is my only critique, I can still give it a thumbs up. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Do I consider myself a minimalist? Depends. Am I going to change my life and relinquish most of my “unnecessary” possessions? Probably not. Do Taylor and I live in a moderate home and live a moderate lifestyle? Very much so. Give and takes. Like I said in the first paragraph, I am always fascinated by these kinds of people, and I am so glad to have taken the time to learn more about the lives of minimalists.

            <p> 
            I have finally finished this book. Funny enough, it is almost the exact same amount of pages as the entirety of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (when you also count the extra readings which maybe I did skip some of). I am not a huge history buff; I would consider myself more of a history respecter. I believe in the usefulness of understanding history and how it pertains to the contemporary world. But, I generally do not seek out historical accounts (besides biographies, I do love a good biography). I especially am not well versed in war. The question is then, Cody, how come you read a thousand pages on what the cover of the book looks like an account of World War II? 
            <br>
            <br>
            This book came at the recommendation of Dr. Pope at Idaho State University. One of the big motivations to moving back to Idaho was to continue my education and get my master’s degree. I was looking through programs, and ISU’s Nuclear Engineering program really took my interest. I ended up sending a cold email to Dr. Pope, who answered almost instantly and asked if I wanted to have a meeting with him. A few days later we went over my resume, and I felt like this was something that I could thrive in and really enjoy. I spent a few more weeks researching what I would need to do, what the job market looks like, and where ultimately I might have to end up moving with Taylor. My guts told me this is what my next step in life should be, so I applied. I am happy to say I was accepted, and I will be starting this fall! In the meantime, I am trying to prepare myself for the trials ahead. Biochemistry is definitely different from nuclear engineering, so I need to give myself any edge I can. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So back to the book, Dr. Pope highly recommended this as a way to learn the history of what nuclear engineering looks like. How we went from really no idea what an atom was to harnessing the powers within it. I enjoyed it very much. I took my time reading it, and I am glad I did because it is jammed packed. Richard Rhodes knew how much info he needed to portray, and he wasted no space. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The first quarter of the book reminds me of the first chapter of any general chemistry 101 textbook. Except in this version,  it’s 250 pages. The first chapter of these textbooks start with a historical account of chemistry, what an atom is, how we figured out what an atom looks like, who discovered the original constants, etc. The first quarter of this book is exactly this, all the names you have ever heard in chemistry: Rutherford, Szilard, Bohr, Germi, Einstein, etc., etc., and their contributions. What’s really interesting, though, is seeing the struggle each of them faced. For example, when I think of Einstein, I think of packed lecture halls and hours spent at his desk. This is not the whole story. Einstein had to be smuggled out of Germany, moved from place to place, was somewhat barred from the Manhattan Project, and did a lot of his thinking while out on his walks. You forget how nuanced people’s lives can be, and Rhodes did a phenomenal job really showing what these great scientists' lives were really like. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This book has quite a large section on World War 1; how chemists and physicists created many compounds for the war. The creation of poison gasses being some of the most famous. What is most interesting to me, though, is during this time, Bohr and other scientists’ goal was to keep science as open as possible. Nothing studied should be kept under lock and key. The only way for science to move forward is through collaboration and questioning of each other’s work. This is a really big point of the book, because it was a very large point of contention during the creation of the atomic bomb due to its secrecy. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Let me backup a bit. Before there was a bomb, there were thoughts and equations that showed large amounts of energy could potentially be removed out of the splitting of atoms. The problem was, no one knew how to harness that energy. There were theories on how to create self propelling chemical reactions, but no one could figure out how to get atoms to do this. The idea was, if you could get an atom to split off a particle, like a neutron, that neutron could then hit another atom, making it lose a neutron, and this cycle could continue on and on. Szilard (and a lot of Fermi) and his nuclear chain reactions would be one of the greatest stepping stones towards the future bomb. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After its discovery, it was decided that this should be kept secret. The math showed that this potential chain reaction could produce amounts of energy unlike anything the world had ever seen. This was also in the time between WWI and WWII. Europe was shaky and no one really knew what was going to happen next. America and Britain were worried that Germany may have access to scientists who could build a bomb, and so began the nuclear arms race. Don’t forget though, this was not as easy as just keeping a secret. The pushback from scientists in the field was immense, and the contention was highly palpable. It really came down to governments forcing scientists to keep it secret. This, of course, made many angry, and the cycle of contempt continued.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am skipping over massive amounts of content and history from the book, so if you want more detail, go read the book. But, what I will say is this: there were not that many people who believed this bomb could be created. Think about it, this technology was so new,  and really, it was not well understood. Even many of those directly working on the project thought it would be a failure. This made progress slow, but there was always this thought in the back of the minds that if Japan or Germany figured it out first, the war would be lost. This kept people motivated and the money flowing. As you would expect, this program was expensive. Obtaining rare materials, building out new labs, paying all these people to work, required tremendous amounts of capital. But as I said, The price of losing this race to a bomb was worth any cost.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was thinking I was going to write a bunch more on the historical accounts, but I don’t think that was really the point of the book for me. The history is important, but the impact it had on everyone’s lives from then to now is what I find to be most important. One of the reasons Japan was bombed was due to the morphing thoughts on what Japanese people were to Americans. Americans witnessed kamikaze bombings, brutal fighting tactics, stealthiness in jungle environments, and Americans began to view the Japanese more like animals than humans. There is a line in the book about how they could never have used it in Germany, because the Germans were too much like Americans or the British. They were white people with families; they were just misguided by Hitler and Nazism. The Japanese were seen as brutal for no reason, just animalistic. Although the capital and other major Japanese landmarks were ultimately spared, the decision to bomb Japan was not fought very hard by military or government strategists. Rhodes describes all of this, but he leaves a large portion of the final chapter to accounts of the aftermath. Those that weren’t killed instantly had severe burns and melted skin, people miles away were affected by radiation poisoning, land was unsalvageable due to vaporization, and the list goes on. It was almost like we as America knew that the bomb would be devastating, but not until post-war when individuals traveled to Japan did anyone realize how egregious the aftermath really was.
            <br>
            <br>
            This leads me to my final thoughts; the point of reading this book, for me, is to realize what can happen if we don’t take the power of nuclear energy seriously enough. We here politicians today talk about nuclear arsenals around the world. We hear of the Middle East, Russia, China, etc. and what they could do if they were to launch a weapon. The problem is, then what? The destruction caused by just the two bombings in Japan is tremendous; the land is unusable and anyone not killed directly deals with the radiation poisoning for the rest of their lives. Generations of land and people gone in a second. Pandora's box of nuclear power has been opened, and its weaponization will remain with us until the end of humankind.
            <br>
            <br>
            This, to me, is a sad thought, but also one in which I feel like there is opportunity. My biggest goal now is to help be a part of a group that is actively trying to use our knowledge of atomic energy to better the lives of everyone. Instead of weapons, figure out how to make nuclear power more safe, clean, and effective. Find new ways of dealing with waste more efficiently; heck, figure out how to make fusion work. Almost eliminate waste entirely. Stop the destruction of natural landscapes for coal and other fuels. This is my soap box, and I am just truly excited to learn more.  In the end, a phenomenal book. One that feels like it will stay with me and will continue to make me think.

            <p>04/14/2023</p>
            <p> 
            I think there is a pretty straight line that could be drawn between most of the books I read, so it can be easy to see why I finally decided to pick this one up. You look just about anywhere for book recommendations, and this one always seems to pop up along the way. After reading, I can definitely see why. There are a lot of good recommendations, practices, and overall life lessons to take out; I just don’t know why I didn’t like it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The book is written in a fashion that I really like. The chapters have a very descriptive title, and you go in knowing what you should be taking out of it. The chapter starts out with a military story from either Jocko Willink or Leif Babin. This story gives a battlefield account of how they used the chapter's ‘point’ to win. The story is then followed up with an in depth description of the principal the story is teaching. The chapter ends with a business world example of how they used the principal with their company, Echelon Front. This way of storytelling is quite good, and it is such a great way of making sure everyone can understand what is being taught. Also where it is done in triplicate, you can’t say that a topic wasn’t covered thoroughly. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a leadership book. There are a lot of topics that can be applied, and really should be applied, to everyday life, but most of them are geared towards those in a leadership position. This is really apparent when you look at some of the major lines of the book like, “there are no bad teams, only bad leaders.” Or even the title of chapter ten, “Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command.” I think this is why I didn’t like the book. I feel I am not yet in a position to completely resonate with the teachings. We all have leadership opportunities in our lives, even when we don’t realize it. If we all take a moment, we can think of things that we are in charge of, people who rely on us, or situations in which we took a main role. But, I feel like I am just not there yet. I feel that I have so much yet to learn about how I operate as a person that it does feel hard to really add these teachings to my life effectively. That is why I am adding this book to my read again pile. I know my time is coming soon where I will need to fall back on teachings like these, and I will have people who truly rely on me. The one thing I truly believe is to be an effective leader, you must know yourself inside and out. You must really know your strengths and weaknesses and know how to apply them effectively. This is a continual journey, but one that needs to be well understood first. I would recommend this book to anyone in a leadership position, because I think it is a great way to take the next step from a point of thinking of ‘self’ to a point of thinking of ‘others’.
            <br>
            <br>
            To say I didn’t like the book then is a lie. I just need a different circumstance to bring this book into my life. None of this probably makes any sense. I keep going back and rereading what I wrote, but I don’t know how else to describe the feeling. With that, there are a couple teachings that I am going to ponder on for the next while:
            <br>
            <br>
            “Don’t ask your leader what you should do, tell them what you are going to do.” I am a very big fan of the act of doing. Maybe I read it in this book, but something I think about is that we think that doing nothing doesn’t have a cost. The cost is in what we do, but this is not true. There is a cost to inaction. There is a cost to indecision. You will never know 100% of the information, but as soon as you have a good idea about what needs to be done, just do it. A big point made in the book is, those above you don’t always know what you go through day to day. They can only know what they know. If there is something bothering you, fix it. If you can’t fix it without approval, tell your superior how you are going to fix it. I know if I was in charge and someone came up to me with a real, sound plan of action, of course I would allow it. We get in these ruts in our own minds and blame others, when we really should just solve the problems ourselves. “Instead of letting the situation dictate our decisions, we must dictate the situation.” A quote from another chapter that just fits well here. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This quote is put a few different ways: “Discipline equals freedom,” “Discipline is the pathway to freedom.” One of my favorite ideas from the book. I think we all get it in our heads that the more discipline we have means less creativity, less fluidity, too much rigidity. This may be true to some extent. Being too disciplined does have its downsides. But, what happens most often, with discipline, is it allows us to explore areas we otherwise never would have been able to. More nuance of situations can be explored. Instead of a fitness example here is a guitar example. Someone has a guitar and picks it up for a few minutes every few days. They may play some notes, maybe they will even figure out some chords, but it would be unlikely that they even really learn to play whole songs. Take this same person and have them sit down for 30 minutes a day learning techniques and theory. What they will learn in just 30 minutes a day for a month would be far greater than someone who just picks it up for years. The discipline allows for nuance and creativity. In this backwards law kind of way, the more rigid you are in your learning, the more creative you can be in practice. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Extreme Ownership.” The title of the book. To Goggins, it would be an “Accountability Mirror”. Angela Duckworth would call it “Personal Sovereignty”. Every single self-help book, podcast, expert opinion, article, will say the exact same thing. You have to take ownership of your life. I would call this the penultimate, nirvana inducing concept. If I wrote a self-help book, it would  be one sentence, “Take responsibility for your life.” That’s it. It would even be the title. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars saved on lectures and books in that one sentence. All other concepts lead to this point. There is nothing more than practicing ownership over your own life. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I’ll save the rating of this book for another day. After I read it again, I promise I’ll come back and give it something. I am now looking towards graduate school, so it’s time to start some summer reading and prepare for the fall.

            <p>03/16/2023</p>
            <p> 
            Let me give you the whole title of the book - <i>Oh Sh*t I Almost Killed You! A Little Book of Big Things Nursing School Forgot to Teach you</i>. So, I am not a nurse; I was a CNA for four years. But, I am not a nurse. Cody, why would you read a book about things that nursing school forgot to teach you? To be honest, I just saw it on our bookshelf, and I thought, “looks good to me.”
            <br>
            <br>
            That last statement isn’t entirely true. Taylor (my wife, if you didn’t read my bio) is a nurse, and I really am interested in knowing what her job looks like. There is just so much time in a work day, especially when those work days are 13 hours long, that I feel like I can’t get a good sense of what it is really like. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This book is not medical at all, and there are hardly any “industry terms.” It is just practical knowledge to apply to nursing. Tidbits about what it's going to be like the first time you work in a clinical setting. She uses the term “baby nurse” to describe those that are fresh and green to the field. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The book is really well written, and it is funny without being cringe or over the top. In fact, I felt like this book didn’t need to be pushed towards nursing, and many of the chapters are just good work advice to new grads overall. Making sure you don’t let work consume you, not letting others put you down, not allowing yourself to feel like you don’t deserve to be there, documenting carefully, handling the ‘oh no!’ moments with a level head, not letting emotions dictate your actions, etc. You see that there are a lot of different things that are talked about. Plus I love books where the chapters are only like 3-5 pages each. It really does show that if you have something to say, you can do it in under a few pages. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Whelp, kind of a silly read, and I don’t know how much nursing knowledge I learned, but glad to have read it. Hard for me to rate where I am not a nurse, but if I was, I would give it an 8.8/10. The book is only like 150 pages, so if you are motivated, it's less than an afternoon read.

                    <img src="../images/BookClubImages/TAOW_Cover.jpg" alt=" The Art of War - Sun Tzu, Cover">
                </div>
            
            <p>03/09/2023</p>
            <p> Ah, ya know, I guess I really didn’t know what The Art of War was. In fact, I was quite confused as I began reading, because I thought I had purchased the wrong addition. I guess I thought I had bought a Cliff Notes version. Nope, that’s just how the book is written. It is not long at all, and it really is just a collection of verses and notes. I read that it really isn’t a book at all. The original copy was carved into bamboo, and predates paper!
            <br>
            <br>
            I will also say, I feel like people just say they have read this book to make them sound cool. I was really excited to read about leadership strategies and useful wisdom. But, what I read was outdated war advice (I should have listened to the lower end reviews). Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of good passages in the first half of the book, but towards the end, eh, take it or leave it. I doubt that I will ever have to vanquish my enemies with fire tactics, so that chapter is a bust. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is always knowledge to be gained in anything you read, and so, I am going to to just put some of my favorite quotes down and think about what they mean to me:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>“When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be dampened. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.”
                <br>
                <br>
                When I read this, I think about all that goes into readying one’s self for “battle”. Whether a big exam or an interview. Those that are more fit will be able to continue longer, and those unprepared will go out first. No matter how fit, though, you will be exhausted by the end. So prepare for this. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>“In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.”
                <br>
                <br>
                This is something I have thought about when I think of the three Hell Weeks Goggins went through. I feel like it isn’t about going through these things over and over. The mind should be focused on the outcome - the victory. Same with school. Don’t think about the time or the redos. Think and push for the outcome. Not that there aren’t great lessons in the process, but don’t get so caught up in the process that you forget what you are doing it for. “Don’t get so caught up fighting alligators that you forget to clean the swamp.”
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>“To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.”
                <br>
                <br>
                You can only worry about yourself. You cannot control what others do. Defeat in most anything means a lack of planning on your own end. But, when opportunities arise, you must be ready to jump on them. In most of these quotes, I don’t think of the enemy as a person, but something you are trying to rise above. A test can be an enemy, a race can be an enemy, and well, I guess a person can be an enemy as well. You must prepare yourself for what life throws, and you can’t expect “the enemy” to just give in. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>“Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.”
                <br>
                <br>
                This is my favorite quote from the book. Be early, be disciplined. I have a lot of school examples, but I will use one again here. If you know a test is in three weeks, you can either start studying now, or you can wait to start later. Those that start immediately will be better prepared and have less stress going into the day. The probability of success of studying the night before is low. The probability of success of three weeks of study is very high. You can choose your chances, but just know what to expect. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>“Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.”
                <br>
                <br>
                I only included this one because this seems to be a fan favorite. It just sounds cool. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
            </ol>
            And that’s about it. I give this read a 6/10, just because it’s a classic, I guess. Maybe if you are looking to mount an attack in the ancient world you can get some good advice from it, but other than that, maybe take some things with a grain of salt.

            <p> Oh <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. An infamously long read, but one that everyone seems to have on their bucket list. It felt like time to read it again, and so over the course of two months, I did it. Tolkien never thought of each of the books, <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, <i>The Two Towers</i>, or <i>The Return of the King</i>, as individual books. He saw it all as one volume, one book: <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I did not feel it prudent to write one long essay at the end of the book. So, I decided to write a quick summary after finishing one half of a single section. I read the most common, and considered most closely written to Tolkien’s original, the 50th anniversary edition. The book is broken into three sections, as listed above, and these sections are cut in half. Altogether making six ‘books’.
            <br>
            <br>
            Please enjoy my hastily written notes. None of them really make too much sense, but I am happy with the outcome. I always recommend taking the time to read the book, even if it does require a lot of time</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>01/12/2023 - The Fellowship of the Ring (Book One)</h3></p>
            <p>Oh, <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>. The first book of the set, and oh does it feel good to have it down. I truly forgot how good <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is. When you are reading <i>The Hobbit</i>, you get lost in Tolkien’s world building and descriptions, but it pales in comparison to the depth of <i>LOTR</i>. Book one only takes you to about the location where Bilbo meets the trolls.  So it takes you over 200 pages to get where about 50 pages takes you in <i>The Hobbit</i>!
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the problems with watching the movies is you don’t get the time scale in which everything takes place. From the time Bilbo disappears at his eleventy-first birthday to when Frodo decides to leave The Shire is years and years. Then, once he is on the trail, it isn’t just days to get to each of the towns and villages, it takes weeks. Tolkien, in the books, really creates this scale of grandeur that is so fun to read. The movies did an okay job, but oh how sweet the book is. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Another problem is I am not smart enough (nor motivated enough) to read and learn all of the lore. There are so many tangents and tales of other kings, writhes, battles, towns, etc. that it can get difficult to follow all of the names. Just as Frodo, Aragon, and the gang reach the hills outside of the elven country, Aragon goes on this multi-page story about the hill they are on and its significance. Cool and all, but it has no bearing on the rest of the story. I know, I know people who love Tolkien absolutely lose their minds over these things, and all of these stories probably tie together in <i>The Silmarillion</i> or one of his other books. I guess this is a silly complaint, because as I sit here thinking about it, the book would not be the same without these stories. I think I am just being a baby.
            <br>
            <br>
            Not much else to say about this one. Really book one lays a solid ground for the rest of the books to build upon. Book one doesn’t feature much Gandalf, so I am excited to get to the wizard parts. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>02/03/2023 - The Fellowship of the Ring (Book Two)</h3></p>
            <p>From the gates of the Last Homely House to the Valley of Shadows, the second book of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> is a description of the journey of the company, while they all remain together. After seeing Bilbo, Elrond, and meeting the council in Rivendell, the company begins its way to Minus Tirith (or at least close enough for Borimir to leave them). The company, including Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf, Legolas, Borimir, Strider, and Gimli, make their way across the lands of Middle Earth. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh how I loved this book. The crossing through the Mines of Moria is such an incredible and fun read. I have always found it sad that Gandalf (The Grey) is lost in the mines, but the story is just incredible. Once out of the mines, the company takes the path to the city of elves, Lothlorien. After a time in the city, the book ends with a splitting of the crew at the beginning of the shadowed valley. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The book really ramps up names and places in this one. What I think Tolkien did such a great job with is, by the end of this book, you really feel like you have a great grasp of what is going on, lore wise. You really do get this sense that without Gandalf, the company really has no idea what they are supposed to be doing; all they know is that they have to do something. They have to get the Ring Bearer somewhere where the Ring cannot be used for malice. I have seen the <i>LOTR</i> too many times, and I feel slightly corrupted by them. The movies make it seem like their goal is cut and dry, just get the ring to Moridor. This is definitely not the case in the book. The ending is just so good. The company splits up, and the real adventure of <i>The Two Towers</i> begins.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm not even worried about writing too good of a report, because I am just excited to start the next book! Whether or not these “analyses” are any good, eh, sue me. See y'all at the end of book one of <i>The Two Towers</i>!
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>02/15/2023 - The Two Towers (Book Three)</h3></p>
            <p>When I think of <i>LOTR</i>, for some reason this book and movie is the one that comes to mind first. I love the side story of Merry and Pippin, and the Ents in Isengard is just *chef’s kiss*. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This book doesn’t feature Frodo or Sam at all. The characters are the rest of the company: Gimli, Aragorn, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, and (oh what a great pleasure) Gandalf. The story splits even further with Merry and Pippin being taken away by orcs, and the rest of the company trying to track them down. You figure out quickly that the Hobbits are being taken to Isengard, because Saruman believes these are the ring-bearers. The company does not pursue Frodo and Sam, because they feel they must let them continue on their path. Plus, they kinda feel bad letting them be tortured. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Across the lands they come to Rohan and meet King Theoden. The movie does this really dramatic thing where he gains his life back and becomes young again, but the book is more metaphorical in this approach. The orcs have already been sent by Saruman to overtake the kingdom, but Gandalf talks him into sending men to fight. The fight in the movie is pretty darn good, but the book does a good job too, I suppose. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But with all of this, one of my favorite moments in <i>The Two Towers</i> is the Ents taking down Isengard. I don’t know why, but the movie and book both really capture these creatures breaking the dam and flooding the lands. Everything accumulates to Gandalf taking over Saruman and destroying his staff. There is also this crystal ball thing that can be used to see Sauron, but I can’t remember what it is called right now. All I know is that it is important down the line. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Whelp, onto book 4 (or book 2 however you view it). This one is back to Frodo and Sam (and Smeagol). The books do get shorter from here on, so it makes me wonder if ole Tolkien started to get tired of writing! Could you imagine writing all of this down on paper with pencil and then going back and writing it all out on a typewriter - then, having to take it to press? No wonder there were a bunch of mistakes in the original text!
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>02/21/2023 - The Two Towers (Book Four)</h3></p>
            <p>Well, I read that one really fast. I got lucky and had a few days where I could put in quite a bit of reading time. I always love when you get unimpeded time like that, because it really is fun having the details of the story right on the front of the brain. I feel like, especially with books like this, that you kind of forget the minute things that really bring the book to life. If you read a book over the course of a few weeks, these things dissipate. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But, just as in the first book of <i>The Two Towers</i>, this story is not about the fellowship as a whole, but it is concerned with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. The story begins with them going down the river and eventually making their way towards Mordor. There is a slight offshoot story of them meeting Faramir, Boromir’s brother, but otherwise it is just them on the trail following Gollum. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Probably the most iconic part of this book is the battle with Shelob, the spider-thing. Gollum betrays the Hobbits (shocking), and Shelob poisons and paralyzes Frodo. Sam believes he is dead and leaves him behind. After his wits finally take over, he returns to Frodo, only to learn that he is, in fact, alive. This is a very short summary of like 100 pages, but you get the point. Just go watch the movie; it really is a pretty cool part. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In a way, it is kind of sad to be in the last book, but also it's not sad because I am ready to leave the fantasy novels behind for another while. Don’t get me wrong, I love LOTR, and I am in no real hurry to finish, but you know how it goes. 1200 pages of wizards and elves does take a slight toll on the brain. </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>03/02/2023 - The Return of the King (Book Five)</h3></p>
            <p>Another one down, and only one more to go! My dumbness really came through when reading this book. I do love the battle of Minas Tirith, and the story of the Path of the Dead, but woah do the names start getting pretty darn deep and heavy.
            This book is, what I would describe as, the second splitting of the original company. Pippin is taken away to Minas Tirith with Gandalf, Merry is kept behind with the king of Rohan, and Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn take the Path of the Dead. There is a whole other story about Faramir and his dad, but it seems like it doesn’t really matter all that much in the grand scheme of things. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The party eventually comes back together and “wins” the battle over the city, but the commanders decide that they must go to Mordor to try and give Frodo and Sam the best chance of destroying the ring. They are trying to draw all of the Mordor forces, and the eye, to the gates. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Like I said though, whoa the names are deep. There are just pages of just kind of hard to follow lore. I feel like I missed some pages, or maybe even a whole book, because I’m just sitting here thinking I have no idea who this or what this is. Tolkien even just changes the title of people, and he uses their old titles interchangeably. I understand this helps give the characters more depth and show their “ranking” up, but dang - I need a little pocket guide! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am actually getting more sad that I am this close to finishing. The last book really is quite short. Maybe I am not as ready to start reading non-fiction again as I thought. Oh-well I suppose. On to the last book, and fingers crossed Frodo makes it to Mount Doom ;). 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>03/04/2023 - The Return of the King (Book Six)</h3></p>
            <p><i>LOTR</i>: Finished. Somehow I finished the final book in just two days, but I couldn’t put it down. Such a good feeling to have this done, and I couldn’t be happier. I know it has been somewhat of a slog to get through, but it is always worth it in the end. The final book is just a real triumph, and it is definitely my favorite book. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the things that I had forgotten is, Frodo and Sam destroy the ring near the beginning of the book. It isn’t like this final page epic story. It is just kind of - they make it into Mount Doom, and Gollum bites off Frodo’s finger. Then boom, the ring is destroyed, and the battle at the Black Gate ends. This build up and build up, and it’s over. It fits well, and it is very fun to read, but it will give you a little chuckle when reading.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next three quarters of the book is just the company going their separate ways, and everyone makes their way back to their homes. There is a brief confrontation with Saruman, and this plays largely into the end chapters. Otherwise, it is just a nice tale of everything being, well, okay. The final chapters, though, you learn that Saruman has ransacked the Shire, and without Gandalf’s help, the Hobbits have to take it back. Also a very fun read, and one that I had also forgotten about.
            <br>
            <br>
            The book ends just kind of like the movie, with Frodo going to the Grey Havens. It is a simple and powerful ending. I cannot say that I will ever be going back to reread this again. I had a lot of fun, and I can put this one away with a smile. I always feel sad when finishing things like this. There really has been a lot of effort and time put into reading and learning. I know none of my writings have been very good, but I think that is the way to do it. I write just enough to not look lazy, but not too much so I can just start the next book. Anyways, onto something else!

            <p>12/29/2022</p>
            <p> From David Goggins to Tolkien, kind of a leap? Yeah, but man have I just had a hankering to read some Tolkien again. Truly, I love <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (which is next on the list), and I think it is good to hit up some fantasy every now and again. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So, a lot of people (nerds) seemed frustrated that <i>The Hobbit</i> is the shortest book but got the most amount of movies. Eh, I don’t agree with this. The book does not translate well into a movie, if going straight from source material. Gandalf is not this all powerful deity figure, the Elf-King isn’t after specific gems, the battle of the five armies is like 3 pages, so you can see that some liberties needed to be taken to make an exciting movie. The movies feel like the book after it has been retold again and again, like a game of telephone, and finally someone decided to write it down. All the best parts get a little bit bigger, and the boring parts get left out. I think the movies are pretty darn good, but (get ready for this hot take) the book is better.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tolkien was making DND campaigns before anyone even knew what those were. The world is lively, and the characters are interesting. Each chapter is like its own mini adventure. Really, just about any chapter could be removed, and the book would still make sense overall. You understand what Bilbo and the dwarves are doing, but just get to see all of the trials leading up to the Lonely Mountain. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I don’t really know what else to say about this book. It really feels like I am in ninth grade again trying to come up with a book report (if only I could find that old report). I’m not a big fantasy reader, I like boring biographies, but this is just a classic. Nothing like reading <i>The Hobbit</i> while it’s cold outside, 10/10.

            <p>Oh no another one of those cringe Joe-Rogan-DMT-log-carrying-boat boys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I bought this book the day it came out, and I have had to force myself to take reading this book slowly, instead of bingeing it in a day. I really wanted time to think about the book between chapters, so I feel that this approach to reading was the way to go.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would like to begin by saying that this book is different from his first. The first book feels like a raw slap to the face. It is inspiring from the first page to the last, but in a boot camp yelling kind of way. This book just doesn’t read like that. You can hear Goggins’ voice, but it's different. It is a more subdued Goggins, and in a way it feels sad. He says it over and over again, in the first book, that he is not a god or special in any way; he is a broken man who just decided to change his life. While reading though, it is hard to believe him. You cannot help but picture him as this hard core deity. I think this is what is so different in his second book. You actually see him as a mortal man, who has been through hardship after hardship, breaking through these seemingly impassable barriers. So maybe saying that it is sad isn’t the right way to put it. It’s more sad in thinking that if even David Goggins starts to falter then what does that mean for the rest of us? But, Goggins’ shows that it really is up to you when you decide to quit. In the final chapter he gives a paragraph that really boils down to: it isn’t about being the best. It is about not quitting. The valiant person is the one who faces long odds and doesn’t back down. The opportunity of life is special, and it isn’t something to be wasted.
            <br>
            <br>
            The book, for the most part, takes place after the events of the first book. It is more a recount of his successes and failures in his 40’s. He is straight up honest, though, in that his body is not the same. He does not sugar coat the fact that his body is beginning to fail. From atrial fibrillation to broken knees to Reynaud’s, he is facing challenges that most people would give into cutting back their routines. He admits that he has those same thoughts. He has nothing to prove, money he doesn’t even know what to do with, a great partner, more confidence than maybe the rest of the navy combined, but he just can’t bring himself to throw in the towel. He calls it “beating back Father Fatigue”. You can’t beat Father Time, but you can beat down Father Fatigue. You can keep your mind and body sharp, as you grow older, but it takes work. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I sit looking through the notes I took on this book, and I just wouldn’t even know where to start in trying to describe them all. Like the first book, Goggins takes you on this wild ride from running Moab 240 to surgeries to smoke jumping, and it is all crazy. It might sound silly, but you could highlight every word in the book, and turn it all into one big quote. It is just that jammed pack full of advice. I hate to even pull out individual quotes, because everything just builds and builds on top of one another. There is a crescendo to the end where you feel everything come together, and you get this just overwhelming sense of happiness. You didn’t even run a single one of the miles, but you can’t help but feel proud. A type of pride in knowing that there is someone out there doing these things, and so, you can’t help but feel inspired. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is reading the book slowly to digest the thoughts and be able to write a nice, long report on the book. Go over all of my favorite parts, write a nice condensed version to be able to look back on, and I could feel good knowing I really read and understood it. But, the only way to get the feeling again is to just read it again. I mean, I’ve read the first book three times now; did I really think it would just take once for this one to sink in? I really kidded myself on that one. This book should just be read. I recommend not listening or reading any summaries or reports of the book. Don’t look at quotes, listen to opinion podcasts, none of it. Just pick up the book and read it (then listen to the newest podcasts with Goggins). This book definitely deserves this kind of treatment. It is not to say that this book is flawless, some of my critiques of the first book still hold into this one, but it doesn’t matter. It is a triumph. I am going to read this book again and again, probably even here within the next few months. There is no way I will be able to stay away from it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is one quote, though, that I have heard him say in a few different places, but is brought up at the beginning, “I am not a theorist. I am a practitioner.” I think this is really every self-help book in 2 sentences. Heck, you could even make it one sentence if you threw in a semicolon. You can sit and theorize ways in which to make yourself better forever. People do this, and Goggins calls them out. The real trick is doing something, anything. Learning is done in practice, not in theorizing. Theorize while practicing. Think of ways of maximizing potential while actively making steps of progress. I could go on and on, but I think this is a good place to end. No score for this one. Maybe after I read it a few more times.

            <p>11/28/2022</p>
            <p> Coming into the new year, I felt it was a good idea to reacquaint myself with some of the thoughts from this book. It has been over a year since I read it last, but I think about it often. Plus, it's a good way to get motivated to set new financial goals. This book is a great take on simple finance. Often money management/ finance books are written towards becoming rich, how to accumulate masses of wealth, and how to beat markets. Morgan Housel takes a different approach and discusses a more simple way of finance, and how to maintain a comfortable life. It fits a category that I am not surprised hasn’t been filled (everyone wants the get rich quick scheme), but one that I feel is pretty important. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Do you just kind of know that you are not going to be ‘rich’? Well I kinda do (crying, crying), but it doesn’t make me too sad. What makes me sad is thinking that I couldn’t become wealthy enough to just enjoy my time and be able to do the things I want. This is a major point in the book, and I would say it is the overarching idea. You don’t have to be fabulously wealthy, but you have to have enough to be comfortable. Everyone’s idea of comfort is different, so you have to define it for yourself and make a plan. This is chapter 7 of the book, entitled “Freedom”. The chapters are laid out as general big ideas of money. The book is very easy to read and digest, as it feels like it was written for people, like me, who have never been in a finance class. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.” This quote comes from chapter 3, “Never Enough”. As the book progresses, Housel gives you the sense that it really is easy to become comfortably wealthy. The trick is, you can’t let your finances get away from you. So many of the examples given throughout the book are of people who were successful and knowledgeable, but they just couldn’t get themselves to stop and maintain what they had acquired. Once they had something, they just looked for the next thing. He later backs this point up with the notion that, “there are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.” There are things in life that shouldn’t be chanced, and these things look different to everyone. The rule of thumb is if it will ruin you if it fails, it isn’t worth it. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t take risks, but think about what will happen if it were to all fall apart. Housel says something along the lines of, planning is great, but plan on your plan not going to plan.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is one chapter in this book that I felt really hit home for me, 14 - “You’ll Change.” It is simply about accepting the fact that we will change. It is so simple, but one that I feel very few people embrace. He talks about how some of the most miserable people he has met are people who are loyal to a career just because that is what they decided to major in at 18. Allowing yourself to realize that you are unhappy in a career and being able to move on is essential to being comfortable. “The trick is to accept the reality of change and move on as soon as possible.” Sunk cost fallacy is everywhere in our lives. We believe because we have put something in, we have to get something out. This just isn’t the case. You are not guaranteed anything, so you might as well enjoy the process and motions of what you are doing. This slightly contradicts the idea of compounding, or letting things grow. The book really hammers the point of not touching your investments. Investments not just being stocks, but also careers and relationships. He gives a decent explanation of this dichotomy, but really it boils down to finding a middle ground. Maybe this could have been described better, but it is so nuanced that it could probably have a book of its own written about it.
            <br>
            <br>
            And maybe that’s the problem. It isn’t that the book doesn’t describe these points, but that broad strokes are given. I frustrate myself by reading books about psychology, because as you would see in my thoughts on <i>Grit</i>, psychology has no set values or ideas. It is a science of ebb and flow. If you say something is true, someone could find multiple examples of it being false. I mean, on the very last page there is a legal notice that Housel or the publisher is not liable if the advice given doesn’t work. I understand that everyone has to cover themselves, but it feels like they themselves don’t believe in it fully; they realize that everything could be different in the future (which funny enough is a chapter in the book). Now don’t let this come across as a bash on the thoughts of the book, for the most part, I feel that they are very sound. It would just be nice to see a discussion on the point of - this book is not infallible. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m looking through all of my notes I took on this book, and I am struggling to put together a way to condense all of the final wisdom into just a few paragraphs. So, I am not even going to try. What I will say about the book is this: there are those who are satisfied and those who are not. Morgan Housel describes strategies that would help take someone from the unsatisfied category and help them achieve the latter. Avoiding extreme ends of financial planning, being too frugal or too risky, is key to success. “Wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent.” There are many people who look wealthy but are so leveraged that all of their time is already sold. This is not where you want to be; you want control over your time and life. Just don’t look at this book as a guide to making money. It really is a book about how to keep the money you already have (or will have). I feel it's a good 4.3/5. I recommend it, and I hope to see another publication by Housel in the future.

            <p> A very short, but great, read. If you haven’t watched the University of Texas at Austin 2014 Commencement Address, please make sure to do so. I remember watching this in high school, and at the time didn’t think too much of it. But just this last year, I watched it again with a group of people, and this time it sank a little deeper. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The book is simply 10 rules for life. In the book, he gives a bit more detail about each of the rules, but in the most concise way possible. Each of his stories are only a couple pages long. Just long enough to give a great picture without bogging down in details. He describes the hardships and successes of his SEAL time, and it comes across as a very genuine love for what he does. In a lot of stories and books about the SEALs (looking at you Goggins) there is a whole lot of detail about just how miserable and hard training is. I don’t blame them; if you are willing to go through SEAL training, you can say whatever you want. Admiral McRaven’s approach, though, is precise. He tells the story without embellishment, and it just reads and feels like he really just wants you to know how each of the rules can be applied. It isn’t about how cool of a war hero he was; it is about making everyone better.
            <br>
            <br>
            The book can be read easily in an afternoon, and so I am going to keep this one short. 5/5, you can’t beat good, easy reads.

            <p>11/11/2022</p>
            <p>I will admit that this book was a grind to get through, but you shouldn’t have it any other way. The book is not easy to read, and there are a lot of terms and names thrown around constantly. Not every line is profound, in fact, most pages are not profound, but as you continue to push, you feel the genius in what he is describing. In a way it feels like I shouldn’t even try to describe the book, because I know I am going to butcher the ideas he is trying to get across. So, take all of this with a grain of salt, as I try to describe all the notes I took. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In the first half, Alan Watts describes the background and history of Zen. With this comes lots of names and terms that we just are never really exposed to in Western thought. Sprinkled in with the history, are ideas that sprung up between the different Zen, Tao, and Buddhist thoughts. Some of the most intriguing I came across was, firstly, the idea of just going with the wind. What is described as a very Western thought are “perfect states”. We think of items, places, people at their most perfect state, and we are constantly seeking this. Watts describes letting go of this and allowing ourselves to not fight change and to see the beauty in what comes next. This leads to a later problem described as the “Western double-binds”. Worry about worrying which leads to more worry. An infinite loop that leads to no good outcomes. In the second half of the book, on teachings, it is thought that you should commit to and move forward. The double-bind can be broken by just choosing a path. Nothing will be perfect, so why try? Move onto what makes you satisfied and pursue. The trick is, you can’t look back once you start. Once you have chosen a path, you must push forward. You are allowed to reflect on what you have chosen, but you cannot reflect on reflecting. This creates worry which leads to the bind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The second idea I’ve thought about a lot since starting the book, you don’t have to justify your life. Western thought demeans those who are “wasting time”. I will admit that in more modern times, and in most self-help books, meditation is a growing trend. Many people prescribe some sort of meditation. This meditation usually is a five minute routine sitting on the floor thinking about and planning your day. I don’t think Watts would argue that this isn’t a form of meditation, but I think he would say this isn’t really what it was meant for. I think he would also say that we still despise those who are wasteful with time. Meditation is allowing yourself to be justified in what you are doing. Because you were born, because you are alive, you are justified. You do not have to fulfill every dream or be unbelievably successful to be justified. You only have to be. “To the Taoist mentality, the aimless empty life does not suggest anything depressing. On the contrary, it suggests the freedom of clouds and mountain streams, wandering nowhere, of flowers in impenetrable canyons, beautiful for no one to see, and of surf forever washing the sand, to no end.” A very difficult idea to swallow. How could no aim, no meaning, lead to anything good? This finally leads to the ideas of satisfaction duality. What is good is only good in relation to what is bad. A quiet empty life compared to one of pain and insatisfaction. It can be thought of as “the higher you are, the harder you fall.” Allowing yourself the freedom to just move with the wind and be free, can lead to a great fulfilment. 
            <br>
            <br>
            None of this is to say you should do nothing. This is not the point at all. Meditation and fulfillment are usually seen as sitting on a mountain side, cross legged, for years on end, but meditation is whatever you make it. If you enjoy your work, your hobbies, family, all of this is meditation - allowing yourself to just be: justified. Allow yourself to enjoy what you do, even if you don’t feel like it is beneficial to society. “Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone,” allow yourself to not stir on indecision and become anxious. Be calm and enjoy the process. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, this is an idea that I am not quite sure on, so you may want to take this with extra grains of salt. I couldn’t quite figure out if everyone is Buddha or anyone can become Buddha. “Those who do know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.” By calling yourself Buddha you have broken the idea of Buddha. Being silent and being allows you to be Buddha. This is a common theme of the book, not allowing yourself to seek but allow yourself to ride the waves. There is no past or future, and the present is self-contained and quiescent. “The flowers depart when we hate to lose them; the weeds arrive while we hate to watch them grow.” In the moments that come, there will be good and bad times, but in those moments remembering your justification and allowing yourself to move with the flow of space. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Trying to surmise the book in a single paragraph would be impossible. Just as there are so many schools of thought in Christianity, so are there in Eastern thought. In this, there is a thought that took me the most. Zen is not about being impulsive and lacking in morality and reflection. Zen is the elimination of blocking of thought and action. Indecision is the killer of fulfillment. Indecision leads to anxiety, but “what comes through the gate is not family treasure.” Much of Zen must be learned on your own. You can’t be told what Zen is; you must live it. I don’t feel like giving this book a rating, but I am glad I found it. In the final pages of the book, Alan Watts reminds, “It’s just this, and nothing else,” so why worry?

            <p>10/6/2022</p>
            <p>Growing up, I had three celebrity crushes: Selena Gomez, Ellie Goulding, and Jennette McCurdy. I remember feeling sad, growing up, knowing that they were just too old for me. I mean, what 18-year-old would go out with a 12-year-old? But this did not stop me from watching way too many hours of iCarly. We didn’t get “high-speed” internet until I was a bit older, so I was never able to go to the iCarly website during its peak (if you go there now it just takes you to the Nickelodeon page). It took a long time to get over this sadness, so you can imagine my happiness when Paramount announced they would be streaming it. Plus, they were going to be revitalizing the show. I have yet to go back and watch any of it (Jennette McCurdy doesn’t come back to the show, which is discussed in the book), but it did remind me of my old crush.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have listened to Jennette McCurdy’s podcast, <i>Empty Inside</i>, on and off since its inception. I was excited to see she had a book coming out, and after finishing Grit, I was ready for a completely different style of writing. This book took me for a ride. Call it cheesy, cringey, or whatever, but this book feels special. Written in a tone that makes you feel like you're reading her personal journal, it feels loose but so articulated at the same time. It doesn’t feel held back, but a lot of these kinds of memoirs seem to be so full of cussing and overly explicit content, that it makes it feel disingenuous. This is most definitely not the case here. The first curse word was used almost half way into the book, and this directly coincided with the transition from ‘active’ Mormon to ‘inactive’. It’s such a subtle but strong indicator in how her life and relationships are moving forward. It may be a silly example, but this book is just full of these shifts that you can just immediately feel, but without the writing really changing. This really is a read-to-understand explanation, so I apologize for that. But man, here I am writing about this book a few days later, and I’m still just as stunned as I was when I read the last sentence.
            <br>
            <br>
            Maybe that last paragraph didn’t make much sense, but the bottom line is this is a must read. This book, though, did not make me feel good. The title, <i>I’m Glad My Mom Died</i>, is shocking, but it captures the soul and essence in five words. In the end she concludes with discussions on how she is making strides forward, but you are left with this feeling that it will never be easy. This book creates this aura of personal reflection; you think about your own life and how true it is for everyone’s struggles. There is no peppy talk or high-fives, it is all just work. Even without living her life, you are just so easily able to superimpose the feelings of the book onto your own thoughts.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started this ‘book club’ to remind myself of the books I’ve read, and maybe so I can remember how they made me feel. This book doesn’t require this, I had to force myself to not just start on page 1 again right after finishing. This book is so powerful, in fact, that it kind of left a void in my reading log. It’s almost like I need a week or two without reading to fully digest and think about what I just read. Kudos to Ms. McCurdy on this achievement, because man oh man I cannot stop thinking about it. Easy 5/5, I couldn’t even begin to critique this book. I was left with no questions and was just genuinely enthralled throughout its entirety.

            <p>09/26/2022</p>
            <p>	After finishing <i>Can’t Hurt Me</i> again, I did some reflecting on other books I would like to reread. I have no idea what the real number is, but if I had to take a guess, you only really remember 1-2% of what you read (or maybe I’m just not very smart). This is what made me want to pick up Grit again. This book is oh-so jam packed with advice and information, and it is sad to think that after reading it twice, I probably still only took in 3%. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I will get it out of the way, this book is not a “fun” read. You don’t ever really feel like going out and doing ultramarathons or climbing Everest; in fact, I would say it's definitely a snoozer. What it lacks in pazaz it makes up whole heartedly with real life advice. It does not feel sugar coated or sing-songy. It describes grit for what it really is - grit. Perseverance in life through thoughtful action, seeing through your end goals, doing the things today that you know you should be doing. Over and over again Dr. Duckworth shows you that no matter how talented you are, without putting in hard work, day in and day out, you will not succeed. She explains so many different life stages and what grit looks like for them, and everything is backed up by real research. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The problem, it is overwhelming with research. You very much understand that she is smart and has a lot to say, but it comes across as fire hydrant information. This is coupled by the fact that psychology has zero absolutes to it. I have a hard time with this, I know I know, there is nuance to everything, but all nuances don’t need to be discussed. I do think the book either needed to be condensed - fewer topics, or expanded - slower pace with more info per topic. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a 4.4/5 read. I will tell you now that if you don’t like ‘academically sounding’ books, you will hate it. You have to be ready to grit your way through it (I made myself chuckle), but I promise once finished, you’ll be so happy you did.

                </div>
            
            <p>08/11/2022</p>
            <p>	At this point if you haven’t read the book, what are you doing? I know what you’re thinking when you hear Goggins, “oh no another one of those cringe Joe-Rogan-DMT-log-carrying-boat boys.” I know, because I think the same way. Once you get past the hype, it truly is incredible what he accomplished. This is a rare book for me in that this is actually my third time reading it. It only gets better each time I’ve read it, and you can’t help but feel at least slightly inspired to try harder. Whenever I start to feel lazy, I read the book to get me back on the horse. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is no such thing as a perfect book, and this is not an exception. I think that if you worship this book, you’re kind of a dummy. The part that kills me is that he says multiple times that his lifestyle basically sucks, and then people go out and try to imitate it. I agree in order to ‘get hard’ you have to do hard things, but to do those things in search of clout - I have yet to see it work out. If you want to imitate Goggins, you can’t just adopt his workouts, but you have to aquire his personality. I think social media is great, and I love to see people’s successes. In fact, I would go as far as to say that I believe people should post more of their successes. Unfortunately when you look at #canthurtme tags, you can’t help but feel the cringe meter tick. For some reason, people love to post that they are going to do 100 days of something, and you only see the first 2 or 3, then it goes dark, never to be seen again. Anybody can do anything for a few days, but it takes grit in order to go the distance (Rocky round 14).
            <br>
            <br>
            That wasn’t a very good critique of the book since it isn’t the book's fault that people try to imitate Goggins. I believe the shortcomings are in the personal life department. I have wondered since the first time I read the book, back in spring 2020, what happened to his child or why he was divorced multiple times. Even if he wants to keep that part of his life private, I do think a statement about protecting their identity would have been good. You can’t claim to have aired all your dirty laundry if there are topics that feel blatantly secret.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that being said, I recommend this book. It is a 4.9/5, and I’ll probably end up reading it again sometime. It feels good knowing there are people out there as passionate and hardworking as Goggins, and I even fall into the trap of thinking I can go run the Moab 240 on Myoplex and Ritz crackers. Maybe that’s why I like the book so much. I think Taylor would be mad at me if I did that, so I think I’ll keep that off to the side for the next while.
