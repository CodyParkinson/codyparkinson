            <p> 
            Let me give you the whole title of the book - <i>Oh Sh*t I Almost Killed You! A Little Book of Big Things Nursing School Forgot to Teach you</i>. So, I am not a nurse; I was a CNA for four years. But, I am not a nurse. Cody, why would you read a book about things that nursing school forgot to teach you? To be honest, I just saw it on our bookshelf, and I thought, “looks good to me.”
            <br>
            <br>
            That last statement isn’t entirely true. Taylor (my wife, if you didn’t read my bio) is a nurse, and I really am interested in knowing what her job looks like. There is just so much time in a work day, especially when those work days are 13 hours long, that I feel like I can’t get a good sense of what it is really like. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This book is not medical at all, and there are hardly any “industry terms.” It is just practical knowledge to apply to nursing. Tidbits about what it's going to be like the first time you work in a clinical setting. She uses the term “baby nurse” to describe those that are fresh and green to the field. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The book is really well written, and it is funny without being cringe or over the top. In fact, I felt like this book didn’t need to be pushed towards nursing, and many of the chapters are just good work advice to new grads overall. Making sure you don’t let work consume you, not letting others put you down, not allowing yourself to feel like you don’t deserve to be there, documenting carefully, handling the ‘oh no!’ moments with a level head, not letting emotions dictate your actions, etc. You see that there are a lot of different things that are talked about. Plus I love books where the chapters are only like 3-5 pages each. It really does show that if you have something to say, you can do it in under a few pages. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Whelp, kind of a silly read, and I don’t know how much nursing knowledge I learned, but glad to have read it. Hard for me to rate where I am not a nurse, but if I was, I would give it an 8.8/10. The book is only like 150 pages, so if you are motivated, it's less than an afternoon read.

                    <img src="../images/BookClubImages/TAOW_Cover.jpg" alt=" The Art of War - Sun Tzu, Cover">
                </div>
            
            <p>03/09/2023</p>
            <p> Ah, ya know, I guess I really didn’t know what The Art of War was. In fact, I was quite confused as I began reading, because I thought I had purchased the wrong addition. I guess I thought I had bought a Cliff Notes version. Nope, that’s just how the book is written. It is not long at all, and it really is just a collection of verses and notes. I read that it really isn’t a book at all. The original copy was carved into bamboo, and predates paper!
            <br>
            <br>
            I will also say, I feel like people just say they have read this book to make them sound cool. I was really excited to read about leadership strategies and useful wisdom. But, what I read was outdated war advice (I should have listened to the lower end reviews). Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of good passages in the first half of the book, but towards the end, eh, take it or leave it. I doubt that I will ever have to vanquish my enemies with fire tactics, so that chapter is a bust. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is always knowledge to be gained in anything you read, and so, I am going to to just put some of my favorite quotes down and think about what they mean to me:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>“When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be dampened. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.”
                <br>
                <br>
                When I read this, I think about all that goes into readying one’s self for “battle”. Whether a big exam or an interview. Those that are more fit will be able to continue longer, and those unprepared will go out first. No matter how fit, though, you will be exhausted by the end. So prepare for this. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>“In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.”
                <br>
                <br>
                This is something I have thought about when I think of the three Hell Weeks Goggins went through. I feel like it isn’t about going through these things over and over. The mind should be focused on the outcome - the victory. Same with school. Don’t think about the time or the redos. Think and push for the outcome. Not that there aren’t great lessons in the process, but don’t get so caught up in the process that you forget what you are doing it for. “Don’t get so caught up fighting alligators that you forget to clean the swamp.”
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>“To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.”
                <br>
                <br>
                You can only worry about yourself. You cannot control what others do. Defeat in most anything means a lack of planning on your own end. But, when opportunities arise, you must be ready to jump on them. In most of these quotes, I don’t think of the enemy as a person, but something you are trying to rise above. A test can be an enemy, a race can be an enemy, and well, I guess a person can be an enemy as well. You must prepare yourself for what life throws, and you can’t expect “the enemy” to just give in. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>“Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.”
                <br>
                <br>
                This is my favorite quote from the book. Be early, be disciplined. I have a lot of school examples, but I will use one again here. If you know a test is in three weeks, you can either start studying now, or you can wait to start later. Those that start immediately will be better prepared and have less stress going into the day. The probability of success of studying the night before is low. The probability of success of three weeks of study is very high. You can choose your chances, but just know what to expect. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
                <li>“Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.”
                <br>
                <br>
                I only included this one because this seems to be a fan favorite. It just sounds cool. 
                <br>
                <br>
                </li>
            </ol>
            And that’s about it. I give this read a 6/10, just because it’s a classic, I guess. Maybe if you are looking to mount an attack in the ancient world you can get some good advice from it, but other than that, maybe take some things with a grain of salt.

                </div>
            
            <p> Oh <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. An infamously long read, but one that everyone seems to have on their bucket list. It felt like time to read it again, and so over the course of two months, I did it. Tolkien never thought of each of the books, <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, <i>The Two Towers</i>, or <i>The Return of the King</i>, as individual books. He saw it all as one volume, one book: <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I did not feel it prudent to write one long essay at the end of the book. So, I decided to write a quick summary after finishing one half of a single section. I read the most common, and considered most closely written to Tolkien’s original, the 50th anniversary edition. The book is broken into three sections, as listed above, and these sections are cut in half. Altogether making six ‘books’.
            <br>
            <br>
            Please enjoy my hastily written notes. None of them really make too much sense, but I am happy with the outcome. I always recommend taking the time to read the book, even if it does require a lot of time</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>01/12/2023 - The Fellowship of the Ring (Book One)</h3></p>
            <p>Oh, <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>. The first book of the set, and oh does it feel good to have it down. I truly forgot how good <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is. When you are reading <i>The Hobbit</i>, you get lost in Tolkien’s world building and descriptions, but it pales in comparison to the depth of <i>LOTR</i>. Book one only takes you to about the location where Bilbo meets the trolls.  So it takes you over 200 pages to get where about 50 pages takes you in <i>The Hobbit</i>!
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the problems with watching the movies is you don’t get the time scale in which everything takes place. From the time Bilbo disappears at his eleventy-first birthday to when Frodo decides to leave The Shire is years and years. Then, once he is on the trail, it isn’t just days to get to each of the towns and villages, it takes weeks. Tolkien, in the books, really creates this scale of grandeur that is so fun to read. The movies did an okay job, but oh how sweet the book is. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Another problem is I am not smart enough (nor motivated enough) to read and learn all of the lore. There are so many tangents and tales of other kings, writhes, battles, towns, etc. that it can get difficult to follow all of the names. Just as Frodo, Aragon, and the gang reach the hills outside of the elven country, Aragon goes on this multi-page story about the hill they are on and its significance. Cool and all, but it has no bearing on the rest of the story. I know, I know people who love Tolkien absolutely lose their minds over these things, and all of these stories probably tie together in <i>The Silmarillion</i> or one of his other books. I guess this is a silly complaint, because as I sit here thinking about it, the book would not be the same without these stories. I think I am just being a baby.
            <br>
            <br>
            Not much else to say about this one. Really book one lays a solid ground for the rest of the books to build upon. Book one doesn’t feature much Gandalf, so I am excited to get to the wizard parts. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>02/03/2023 - The Fellowship of the Ring (Book Two)</h3></p>
            <p>From the gates of the Last Homely House to the Valley of Shadows, the second book of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> is a description of the journey of the company, while they all remain together. After seeing Bilbo, Elrond, and meeting the council in Rivendell, the company begins its way to Minus Tirith (or at least close enough for Borimir to leave them). The company, including Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf, Legolas, Borimir, Strider, and Gimli, make their way across the lands of Middle Earth. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh how I loved this book. The crossing through the Mines of Moria is such an incredible and fun read. I have always found it sad that Gandalf (The Grey) is lost in the mines, but the story is just incredible. Once out of the mines, the company takes the path to the city of elves, Lothlorien. After a time in the city, the book ends with a splitting of the crew at the beginning of the shadowed valley. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The book really ramps up names and places in this one. What I think Tolkien did such a great job with is, by the end of this book, you really feel like you have a great grasp of what is going on, lore wise. You really do get this sense that without Gandalf, the company really has no idea what they are supposed to be doing; all they know is that they have to do something. They have to get the Ring Bearer somewhere where the Ring cannot be used for malice. I have seen the <i>LOTR</i> too many times, and I feel slightly corrupted by them. The movies make it seem like their goal is cut and dry, just get the ring to Moridor. This is definitely not the case in the book. The ending is just so good. The company splits up, and the real adventure of <i>The Two Towers</i> begins.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm not even worried about writing too good of a report, because I am just excited to start the next book! Whether or not these “analyses” are any good, eh, sue me. See y'all at the end of book one of <i>The Two Towers</i>!
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>02/15/2023 - The Two Towers (Book Three)</h3></p>
            <p>When I think of <i>LOTR</i>, for some reason this book and movie is the one that comes to mind first. I love the side story of Merry and Pippin, and the Ents in Isengard is just *chef’s kiss*. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This book doesn’t feature Frodo or Sam at all. The characters are the rest of the company: Gimli, Aragorn, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, and (oh what a great pleasure) Gandalf. The story splits even further with Merry and Pippin being taken away by orcs, and the rest of the company trying to track them down. You figure out quickly that the Hobbits are being taken to Isengard, because Saruman believes these are the ring-bearers. The company does not pursue Frodo and Sam, because they feel they must let them continue on their path. Plus, they kinda feel bad letting them be tortured. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Across the lands they come to Rohan and meet King Theoden. The movie does this really dramatic thing where he gains his life back and becomes young again, but the book is more metaphorical in this approach. The orcs have already been sent by Saruman to overtake the kingdom, but Gandalf talks him into sending men to fight. The fight in the movie is pretty darn good, but the book does a good job too, I suppose. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But with all of this, one of my favorite moments in <i>The Two Towers</i> is the Ents taking down Isengard. I don’t know why, but the movie and book both really capture these creatures breaking the dam and flooding the lands. Everything accumulates to Gandalf taking over Saruman and destroying his staff. There is also this crystal ball thing that can be used to see Sauron, but I can’t remember what it is called right now. All I know is that it is important down the line. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Whelp, onto book 4 (or book 2 however you view it). This one is back to Frodo and Sam (and Smeagol). The books do get shorter from here on, so it makes me wonder if ole Tolkien started to get tired of writing! Could you imagine writing all of this down on paper with pencil and then going back and writing it all out on a typewriter - then, having to take it to press? No wonder there were a bunch of mistakes in the original text!
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>02/21/2023 - The Two Towers (Book Four)</h3></p>
            <p>Well, I read that one really fast. I got lucky and had a few days where I could put in quite a bit of reading time. I always love when you get unimpeded time like that, because it really is fun having the details of the story right on the front of the brain. I feel like, especially with books like this, that you kind of forget the minute things that really bring the book to life. If you read a book over the course of a few weeks, these things dissipate. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But, just as in the first book of <i>The Two Towers</i>, this story is not about the fellowship as a whole, but it is concerned with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. The story begins with them going down the river and eventually making their way towards Mordor. There is a slight offshoot story of them meeting Faramir, Boromir’s brother, but otherwise it is just them on the trail following Gollum. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Probably the most iconic part of this book is the battle with Shelob, the spider-thing. Gollum betrays the Hobbits (shocking), and Shelob poisons and paralyzes Frodo. Sam believes he is dead and leaves him behind. After his wits finally take over, he returns to Frodo, only to learn that he is, in fact, alive. This is a very short summary of like 100 pages, but you get the point. Just go watch the movie; it really is a pretty cool part. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In a way, it is kind of sad to be in the last book, but also it's not sad because I am ready to leave the fantasy novels behind for another while. Don’t get me wrong, I love LOTR, and I am in no real hurry to finish, but you know how it goes. 1200 pages of wizards and elves does take a slight toll on the brain. </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>03/02/2023 - The Return of the King (Book Five)</h3></p>
            <p>Another one down, and only one more to go! My dumbness really came through when reading this book. I do love the battle of Minas Tirith, and the story of the Path of the Dead, but woah do the names start getting pretty darn deep and heavy.
            This book is, what I would describe as, the second splitting of the original company. Pippin is taken away to Minas Tirith with Gandalf, Merry is kept behind with the king of Rohan, and Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn take the Path of the Dead. There is a whole other story about Faramir and his dad, but it seems like it doesn’t really matter all that much in the grand scheme of things. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The party eventually comes back together and “wins” the battle over the city, but the commanders decide that they must go to Mordor to try and give Frodo and Sam the best chance of destroying the ring. They are trying to draw all of the Mordor forces, and the eye, to the gates. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Like I said though, whoa the names are deep. There are just pages of just kind of hard to follow lore. I feel like I missed some pages, or maybe even a whole book, because I’m just sitting here thinking I have no idea who this or what this is. Tolkien even just changes the title of people, and he uses their old titles interchangeably. I understand this helps give the characters more depth and show their “ranking” up, but dang - I need a little pocket guide! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am actually getting more sad that I am this close to finishing. The last book really is quite short. Maybe I am not as ready to start reading non-fiction again as I thought. Oh-well I suppose. On to the last book, and fingers crossed Frodo makes it to Mount Doom ;). 
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><h3>03/04/2023 - The Return of the King (Book Six)</h3></p>
            <p><i>LOTR</i>: Finished. Somehow I finished the final book in just two days, but I couldn’t put it down. Such a good feeling to have this done, and I couldn’t be happier. I know it has been somewhat of a slog to get through, but it is always worth it in the end. The final book is just a real triumph, and it is definitely my favorite book. 
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the things that I had forgotten is, Frodo and Sam destroy the ring near the beginning of the book. It isn’t like this final page epic story. It is just kind of - they make it into Mount Doom, and Gollum bites off Frodo’s finger. Then boom, the ring is destroyed, and the battle at the Black Gate ends. This build up and build up, and it’s over. It fits well, and it is very fun to read, but it will give you a little chuckle when reading.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next three quarters of the book is just the company going their separate ways, and everyone makes their way back to their homes. There is a brief confrontation with Saruman, and this plays largely into the end chapters. Otherwise, it is just a nice tale of everything being, well, okay. The final chapters, though, you learn that Saruman has ransacked the Shire, and without Gandalf’s help, the Hobbits have to take it back. Also a very fun read, and one that I had also forgotten about.
            <br>
            <br>
            The book ends just kind of like the movie, with Frodo going to the Grey Havens. It is a simple and powerful ending. I cannot say that I will ever be going back to reread this again. I had a lot of fun, and I can put this one away with a smile. I always feel sad when finishing things like this. There really has been a lot of effort and time put into reading and learning. I know none of my writings have been very good, but I think that is the way to do it. I write just enough to not look lazy, but not too much so I can just start the next book. Anyways, onto something else!

            <p> From David Goggins to Tolkien, kind of a leap? Yeah, but man have I just had a hankering to read some Tolkien again. Truly, I love <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (which is next on the list), and I think it is good to hit up some fantasy every now and again. 
            <br>
            <br>
            So, a lot of people (nerds) seemed frustrated that <i>The Hobbit</i> is the shortest book but got the most amount of movies. Eh, I don’t agree with this. The book does not translate well into a movie, if going straight from source material. Gandalf is not this all powerful deity figure, the Elf-King isn’t after specific gems, the battle of the five armies is like 3 pages, so you can see that some liberties needed to be taken to make an exciting movie. The movies feel like the book after it has been retold again and again, like a game of telephone, and finally someone decided to write it down. All the best parts get a little bit bigger, and the boring parts get left out. I think the movies are pretty darn good, but (get ready for this hot take) the book is better.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tolkien was making DND campaigns before anyone even knew what those were. The world is lively, and the characters are interesting. Each chapter is like its own mini adventure. Really, just about any chapter could be removed, and the book would still make sense overall. You understand what Bilbo and the dwarves are doing, but just get to see all of the trials leading up to the Lonely Mountain. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I don’t really know what else to say about this book. It really feels like I am in ninth grade again trying to come up with a book report (if only I could find that old report). I’m not a big fantasy reader, I like boring biographies, but this is just a classic. Nothing like reading <i>The Hobbit</i> while it’s cold outside, 10/10.

            <p>Oh no another one of those cringe Joe-Rogan-DMT-log-carrying-boat boys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I bought this book the day it came out, and I have had to force myself to take reading this book slowly, instead of bingeing it in a day. I really wanted time to think about the book between chapters, so I feel that this approach to reading was the way to go.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would like to begin by saying that this book is different from his first. The first book feels like a raw slap to the face. It is inspiring from the first page to the last, but in a boot camp yelling kind of way. This book just doesn’t read like that. You can hear Goggins’ voice, but it's different. It is a more subdued Goggins, and in a way it feels sad. He says it over and over again, in the first book, that he is not a god or special in any way; he is a broken man who just decided to change his life. While reading though, it is hard to believe him. You cannot help but picture him as this hard core deity. I think this is what is so different in his second book. You actually see him as a mortal man, who has been through hardship after hardship, breaking through these seemingly impassable barriers. So maybe saying that it is sad isn’t the right way to put it. It’s more sad in thinking that if even David Goggins starts to falter then what does that mean for the rest of us? But, Goggins’ shows that it really is up to you when you decide to quit. In the final chapter he gives a paragraph that really boils down to: it isn’t about being the best. It is about not quitting. The valiant person is the one who faces long odds and doesn’t back down. The opportunity of life is special, and it isn’t something to be wasted.
            <br>
            <br>
            The book, for the most part, takes place after the events of the first book. It is more a recount of his successes and failures in his 40’s. He is straight up honest, though, in that his body is not the same. He does not sugar coat the fact that his body is beginning to fail. From atrial fibrillation to broken knees to Reynaud’s, he is facing challenges that most people would give into cutting back their routines. He admits that he has those same thoughts. He has nothing to prove, money he doesn’t even know what to do with, a great partner, more confidence than maybe the rest of the navy combined, but he just can’t bring himself to throw in the towel. He calls it “beating back Father Fatigue”. You can’t beat Father Time, but you can beat down Father Fatigue. You can keep your mind and body sharp, as you grow older, but it takes work. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I sit looking through the notes I took on this book, and I just wouldn’t even know where to start in trying to describe them all. Like the first book, Goggins takes you on this wild ride from running Moab 240 to surgeries to smoke jumping, and it is all crazy. It might sound silly, but you could highlight every word in the book, and turn it all into one big quote. It is just that jammed pack full of advice. I hate to even pull out individual quotes, because everything just builds and builds on top of one another. There is a crescendo to the end where you feel everything come together, and you get this just overwhelming sense of happiness. You didn’t even run a single one of the miles, but you can’t help but feel proud. A type of pride in knowing that there is someone out there doing these things, and so, you can’t help but feel inspired. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is reading the book slowly to digest the thoughts and be able to write a nice, long report on the book. Go over all of my favorite parts, write a nice condensed version to be able to look back on, and I could feel good knowing I really read and understood it. But, the only way to get the feeling again is to just read it again. I mean, I’ve read the first book three times now; did I really think it would just take once for this one to sink in? I really kidded myself on that one. This book should just be read. I recommend not listening or reading any summaries or reports of the book. Don’t look at quotes, listen to opinion podcasts, none of it. Just pick up the book and read it (then listen to the newest podcasts with Goggins). This book definitely deserves this kind of treatment. It is not to say that this book is flawless, some of my critiques of the first book still hold into this one, but it doesn’t matter. It is a triumph. I am going to read this book again and again, probably even here within the next few months. There is no way I will be able to stay away from it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is one quote, though, that I have heard him say in a few different places, but is brought up at the beginning, “I am not a theorist. I am a practitioner.” I think this is really every self-help book in 2 sentences. Heck, you could even make it one sentence if you threw in a semicolon. You can sit and theorize ways in which to make yourself better forever. People do this, and Goggins calls them out. The real trick is doing something, anything. Learning is done in practice, not in theorizing. Theorize while practicing. Think of ways of maximizing potential while actively making steps of progress. I could go on and on, but I think this is a good place to end. No score for this one. Maybe after I read it a few more times.

            <p>11/28/2022</p>
            <p> Coming into the new year, I felt it was a good idea to reacquaint myself with some of the thoughts from this book. It has been over a year since I read it last, but I think about it often. Plus, it's a good way to get motivated to set new financial goals. This book is a great take on simple finance. Often money management/ finance books are written towards becoming rich, how to accumulate masses of wealth, and how to beat markets. Morgan Housel takes a different approach and discusses a more simple way of finance, and how to maintain a comfortable life. It fits a category that I am not surprised hasn’t been filled (everyone wants the get rich quick scheme), but one that I feel is pretty important. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Do you just kind of know that you are not going to be ‘rich’? Well I kinda do (crying, crying), but it doesn’t make me too sad. What makes me sad is thinking that I couldn’t become wealthy enough to just enjoy my time and be able to do the things I want. This is a major point in the book, and I would say it is the overarching idea. You don’t have to be fabulously wealthy, but you have to have enough to be comfortable. Everyone’s idea of comfort is different, so you have to define it for yourself and make a plan. This is chapter 7 of the book, entitled “Freedom”. The chapters are laid out as general big ideas of money. The book is very easy to read and digest, as it feels like it was written for people, like me, who have never been in a finance class. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.” This quote comes from chapter 3, “Never Enough”. As the book progresses, Housel gives you the sense that it really is easy to become comfortably wealthy. The trick is, you can’t let your finances get away from you. So many of the examples given throughout the book are of people who were successful and knowledgeable, but they just couldn’t get themselves to stop and maintain what they had acquired. Once they had something, they just looked for the next thing. He later backs this point up with the notion that, “there are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.” There are things in life that shouldn’t be chanced, and these things look different to everyone. The rule of thumb is if it will ruin you if it fails, it isn’t worth it. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t take risks, but think about what will happen if it were to all fall apart. Housel says something along the lines of, planning is great, but plan on your plan not going to plan.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is one chapter in this book that I felt really hit home for me, 14 - “You’ll Change.” It is simply about accepting the fact that we will change. It is so simple, but one that I feel very few people embrace. He talks about how some of the most miserable people he has met are people who are loyal to a career just because that is what they decided to major in at 18. Allowing yourself to realize that you are unhappy in a career and being able to move on is essential to being comfortable. “The trick is to accept the reality of change and move on as soon as possible.” Sunk cost fallacy is everywhere in our lives. We believe because we have put something in, we have to get something out. This just isn’t the case. You are not guaranteed anything, so you might as well enjoy the process and motions of what you are doing. This slightly contradicts the idea of compounding, or letting things grow. The book really hammers the point of not touching your investments. Investments not just being stocks, but also careers and relationships. He gives a decent explanation of this dichotomy, but really it boils down to finding a middle ground. Maybe this could have been described better, but it is so nuanced that it could probably have a book of its own written about it.
            <br>
            <br>
            And maybe that’s the problem. It isn’t that the book doesn’t describe these points, but that broad strokes are given. I frustrate myself by reading books about psychology, because as you would see in my thoughts on <i>Grit</i>, psychology has no set values or ideas. It is a science of ebb and flow. If you say something is true, someone could find multiple examples of it being false. I mean, on the very last page there is a legal notice that Housel or the publisher is not liable if the advice given doesn’t work. I understand that everyone has to cover themselves, but it feels like they themselves don’t believe in it fully; they realize that everything could be different in the future (which funny enough is a chapter in the book). Now don’t let this come across as a bash on the thoughts of the book, for the most part, I feel that they are very sound. It would just be nice to see a discussion on the point of - this book is not infallible. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m looking through all of my notes I took on this book, and I am struggling to put together a way to condense all of the final wisdom into just a few paragraphs. So, I am not even going to try. What I will say about the book is this: there are those who are satisfied and those who are not. Morgan Housel describes strategies that would help take someone from the unsatisfied category and help them achieve the latter. Avoiding extreme ends of financial planning, being too frugal or too risky, is key to success. “Wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent.” There are many people who look wealthy but are so leveraged that all of their time is already sold. This is not where you want to be; you want control over your time and life. Just don’t look at this book as a guide to making money. It really is a book about how to keep the money you already have (or will have). I feel it's a good 4.3/5. I recommend it, and I hope to see another publication by Housel in the future.

            <p> A very short, but great, read. If you haven’t watched the University of Texas at Austin 2014 Commencement Address, please make sure to do so. I remember watching this in high school, and at the time didn’t think too much of it. But just this last year, I watched it again with a group of people, and this time it sank a little deeper. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The book is simply 10 rules for life. In the book, he gives a bit more detail about each of the rules, but in the most concise way possible. Each of his stories are only a couple pages long. Just long enough to give a great picture without bogging down in details. He describes the hardships and successes of his SEAL time, and it comes across as a very genuine love for what he does. In a lot of stories and books about the SEALs (looking at you Goggins) there is a whole lot of detail about just how miserable and hard training is. I don’t blame them; if you are willing to go through SEAL training, you can say whatever you want. Admiral McRaven’s approach, though, is precise. He tells the story without embellishment, and it just reads and feels like he really just wants you to know how each of the rules can be applied. It isn’t about how cool of a war hero he was; it is about making everyone better.
            <br>
            <br>
            The book can be read easily in an afternoon, and so I am going to keep this one short. 5/5, you can’t beat good, easy reads.

            <p>11/11/2022</p>
            <p>I will admit that this book was a grind to get through, but you shouldn’t have it any other way. The book is not easy to read, and there are a lot of terms and names thrown around constantly. Not every line is profound, in fact, most pages are not profound, but as you continue to push, you feel the genius in what he is describing. In a way it feels like I shouldn’t even try to describe the book, because I know I am going to butcher the ideas he is trying to get across. So, take all of this with a grain of salt, as I try to describe all the notes I took. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In the first half, Alan Watts describes the background and history of Zen. With this comes lots of names and terms that we just are never really exposed to in Western thought. Sprinkled in with the history, are ideas that sprung up between the different Zen, Tao, and Buddhist thoughts. Some of the most intriguing I came across was, firstly, the idea of just going with the wind. What is described as a very Western thought are “perfect states”. We think of items, places, people at their most perfect state, and we are constantly seeking this. Watts describes letting go of this and allowing ourselves to not fight change and to see the beauty in what comes next. This leads to a later problem described as the “Western double-binds”. Worry about worrying which leads to more worry. An infinite loop that leads to no good outcomes. In the second half of the book, on teachings, it is thought that you should commit to and move forward. The double-bind can be broken by just choosing a path. Nothing will be perfect, so why try? Move onto what makes you satisfied and pursue. The trick is, you can’t look back once you start. Once you have chosen a path, you must push forward. You are allowed to reflect on what you have chosen, but you cannot reflect on reflecting. This creates worry which leads to the bind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The second idea I’ve thought about a lot since starting the book, you don’t have to justify your life. Western thought demeans those who are “wasting time”. I will admit that in more modern times, and in most self-help books, meditation is a growing trend. Many people prescribe some sort of meditation. This meditation usually is a five minute routine sitting on the floor thinking about and planning your day. I don’t think Watts would argue that this isn’t a form of meditation, but I think he would say this isn’t really what it was meant for. I think he would also say that we still despise those who are wasteful with time. Meditation is allowing yourself to be justified in what you are doing. Because you were born, because you are alive, you are justified. You do not have to fulfill every dream or be unbelievably successful to be justified. You only have to be. “To the Taoist mentality, the aimless empty life does not suggest anything depressing. On the contrary, it suggests the freedom of clouds and mountain streams, wandering nowhere, of flowers in impenetrable canyons, beautiful for no one to see, and of surf forever washing the sand, to no end.” A very difficult idea to swallow. How could no aim, no meaning, lead to anything good? This finally leads to the ideas of satisfaction duality. What is good is only good in relation to what is bad. A quiet empty life compared to one of pain and insatisfaction. It can be thought of as “the higher you are, the harder you fall.” Allowing yourself the freedom to just move with the wind and be free, can lead to a great fulfilment. 
            <br>
            <br>
            None of this is to say you should do nothing. This is not the point at all. Meditation and fulfillment are usually seen as sitting on a mountain side, cross legged, for years on end, but meditation is whatever you make it. If you enjoy your work, your hobbies, family, all of this is meditation - allowing yourself to just be: justified. Allow yourself to enjoy what you do, even if you don’t feel like it is beneficial to society. “Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone,” allow yourself to not stir on indecision and become anxious. Be calm and enjoy the process. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, this is an idea that I am not quite sure on, so you may want to take this with extra grains of salt. I couldn’t quite figure out if everyone is Buddha or anyone can become Buddha. “Those who do know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.” By calling yourself Buddha you have broken the idea of Buddha. Being silent and being allows you to be Buddha. This is a common theme of the book, not allowing yourself to seek but allow yourself to ride the waves. There is no past or future, and the present is self-contained and quiescent. “The flowers depart when we hate to lose them; the weeds arrive while we hate to watch them grow.” In the moments that come, there will be good and bad times, but in those moments remembering your justification and allowing yourself to move with the flow of space. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Trying to surmise the book in a single paragraph would be impossible. Just as there are so many schools of thought in Christianity, so are there in Eastern thought. In this, there is a thought that took me the most. Zen is not about being impulsive and lacking in morality and reflection. Zen is the elimination of blocking of thought and action. Indecision is the killer of fulfillment. Indecision leads to anxiety, but “what comes through the gate is not family treasure.” Much of Zen must be learned on your own. You can’t be told what Zen is; you must live it. I don’t feel like giving this book a rating, but I am glad I found it. In the final pages of the book, Alan Watts reminds, “It’s just this, and nothing else,” so why worry?

            <p>10/6/2022</p>
            <p>Growing up, I had three celebrity crushes: Selena Gomez, Ellie Goulding, and Jennette McCurdy. I remember feeling sad, growing up, knowing that they were just too old for me. I mean, what 18-year-old would go out with a 12-year-old? But this did not stop me from watching way too many hours of iCarly. We didn’t get “high-speed” internet until I was a bit older, so I was never able to go to the iCarly website during its peak (if you go there now it just takes you to the Nickelodeon page). It took a long time to get over this sadness, so you can imagine my happiness when Paramount announced they would be streaming it. Plus, they were going to be revitalizing the show. I have yet to go back and watch any of it (Jennette McCurdy doesn’t come back to the show, which is discussed in the book), but it did remind me of my old crush.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have listened to Jennette McCurdy’s podcast, <i>Empty Inside</i>, on and off since its inception. I was excited to see she had a book coming out, and after finishing Grit, I was ready for a completely different style of writing. This book took me for a ride. Call it cheesy, cringey, or whatever, but this book feels special. Written in a tone that makes you feel like you're reading her personal journal, it feels loose but so articulated at the same time. It doesn’t feel held back, but a lot of these kinds of memoirs seem to be so full of cussing and overly explicit content, that it makes it feel disingenuous. This is most definitely not the case here. The first curse word was used almost half way into the book, and this directly coincided with the transition from ‘active’ Mormon to ‘inactive’. It’s such a subtle but strong indicator in how her life and relationships are moving forward. It may be a silly example, but this book is just full of these shifts that you can just immediately feel, but without the writing really changing. This really is a read-to-understand explanation, so I apologize for that. But man, here I am writing about this book a few days later, and I’m still just as stunned as I was when I read the last sentence.

            Maybe that last paragraph didn’t make much sense, but the bottom line is this is a must read. This book, though, did not make me feel good. The title, <i>I’m Glad My Mom Died</i>, is shocking, but it captures the soul and essence in five words. In the end she concludes with discussions on how she is making strides forward, but you are left with this feeling that it will never be easy. This book creates this aura of personal reflection; you think about your own life and how true it is for everyone’s struggles. There is no peppy talk or high-fives, it is all just work. Even without living her life, you are just so easily able to superimpose the feelings of the book onto your own thoughts.

            I started this ‘book club’ to remind myself of the books I’ve read, and maybe so I can remember how they made me feel. This book doesn’t require this, I had to force myself to not just start on page 1 again right after finishing. This book is so powerful, in fact, that it kind of left a void in my reading log. It’s almost like I need a week or two without reading to fully digest and think about what I just read. Kudos to Ms. McCurdy on this achievement, because man oh man I cannot stop thinking about it. Easy 5/5, I couldn’t even begin to critique this book. I was left with no questions and was just genuinely enthralled throughout its entirety.

            <p>	After finishing <i>Can’t Hurt Me</i> again, I did some reflecting on other books I would like to reread. I have no idea what the real number is, but if I had to take a guess, you only really remember 1-2% of what you read (or maybe I’m just not very smart). This is what made me want to pick up Grit again. This book is oh-so jam packed with advice and information, and it is sad to think that after reading it twice, I probably still only took in 3%. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I will get it out of the way, this book is not a “fun” read. You don’t ever really feel like going out and doing ultramarathons or climbing Everest; in fact, I would say it's definitely a snoozer. What it lacks in pazaz it makes up whole heartedly with real life advice. It does not feel sugar coated or sing-songy. It describes grit for what it really is - grit. Perseverance in life through thoughtful action, seeing through your end goals, doing the things today that you know you should be doing. Over and over again Dr. Duckworth shows you that no matter how talented you are, without putting in hard work, day in and day out, you will not succeed. She explains so many different life stages and what grit looks like for them, and everything is backed up by real research. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The problem, it is overwhelming with research. You very much understand that she is smart and has a lot to say, but it comes across as fire hydrant information. This is coupled by the fact that psychology has zero absolutes to it. I have a hard time with this, I know I know, there is nuance to everything, but all nuances don’t need to be discussed. I do think the book either needed to be condensed - fewer topics, or expanded - slower pace with more info per topic. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a 4.4/5 read. I will tell you now that if you don’t like ‘academically sounding’ books, you will hate it. You have to be ready to grit your way through it (I made myself chuckle), but I promise once finished, you’ll be so happy you did.

            <p>	At this point if you haven’t read the book, what are you doing? I know what you’re thinking when you hear Goggins, “oh no another one of those cringe Joe-Rogan-DMT-log-carrying-boat boys.” I know, because I think the same way. Once you get past the hype, it truly is incredible what he accomplished. This is a rare book for me in that this is actually my third time reading it. It only gets better each time I’ve read it, and you can’t help but feel at least slightly inspired to try harder. Whenever I start to feel lazy, I read the book to get me back on the horse. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is no such thing as a perfect book, and this is not an exception. I think that if you worship this book, you’re kind of a dummy. The part that kills me is that he says multiple times that his lifestyle basically sucks, and then people go out and try to imitate it. I agree in order to ‘get hard’ you have to do hard things, but to do those things in search of clout - I have yet to see it work out. If you want to imitate Goggins, you can’t just adopt his workouts, but you have to aquire his personality. I think social media is great, and I love to see people’s successes. In fact, I would go as far as to say that I believe people should post more of their successes. Unfortunately when you look at #canthurtme tags, you can’t help but feel the cringe meter tick. For some reason, people love to post that they are going to do 100 days of something, and you only see the first 2 or 3, then it goes dark, never to be seen again. Anybody can do anything for a few days, but it takes grit in order to go the distance (Rocky round 14).
            <br>
            <br>
            That wasn’t a very good critique of the book since it isn’t the book's fault that people try to imitate Goggins. I believe the shortcomings are in the personal life department. I have wondered since the first time I read the book, back in spring 2020, what happened to his child or why he was divorced multiple times. Even if he wants to keep that part of his life private, I do think a statement about protecting their identity would have been good. You can’t claim to have aired all your dirty laundry if there are topics that feel blatantly secret.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that being said, I recommend this book. It is a 4.9/5, and I’ll probably end up reading it again sometime. It feels good knowing there are people out there as passionate and hardworking as Goggins, and I even fall into the trap of thinking I can go run the Moab 240 on Myoplex and Ritz crackers. Maybe that’s why I like the book so much. I think Taylor would be mad at me if I did that, so I think I’ll keep that off to the side for the next while.
