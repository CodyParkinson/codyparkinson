            <p>11/28/2022</p>
            <p> Coming into the new year, I felt it was a good idea to reacquaint myself with some of the thoughts from this book. It has been over a year since I read it last, but I think about it often. Plus, it's a good way to get motivated to set new financial goals. This book is a great take on simple finance. Often money management/ finance books are written towards becoming rich, how to accumulate masses of wealth, and how to beat markets. Morgan Housel takes a different approach and discusses a more simple way of finance, and how to maintain a comfortable life. It fits a category that I am not surprised hasn’t been filled (everyone wants the get rich quick scheme), but one that I feel is pretty important. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Do you just kind of know that you are not going to be ‘rich’? Well I kinda do (crying, crying), but it doesn’t make me too sad. What makes me sad is thinking that I couldn’t become wealthy enough to just enjoy my time and be able to do the things I want. This is a major point in the book, and I would say it is the overarching idea. You don’t have to be fabulously wealthy, but you have to have enough to be comfortable. Everyone’s idea of comfort is different, so you have to define it for yourself and make a plan. This is chapter 7 of the book, entitled “Freedom”. The chapters are laid out as general big ideas of money. The book is very easy to read and digest, as it feels like it was written for people, like me, who have never been in a finance class. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.” This quote comes from chapter 3, “Never Enough”. As the book progresses, Housel gives you the sense that it really is easy to become comfortably wealthy. The trick is, you can’t let your finances get away from you. So many of the examples given throughout the book are of people who were successful and knowledgeable, but they just couldn’t get themselves to stop and maintain what they had acquired. Once they had something, they just looked for the next thing. He later backs this point up with the notion that, “there are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.” There are things in life that shouldn’t be chanced, and these things look different to everyone. The rule of thumb is if it will ruin you if it fails, it isn’t worth it. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t take risks, but think about what will happen if it were to all fall apart. Housel says something along the lines of, planning is great, but plan on your plan not going to plan.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is one chapter in this book that I felt really hit home for me, 14 - “You’ll Change.” It is simply about accepting the fact that we will change. It is so simple, but one that I feel very few people embrace. He talks about how some of the most miserable people he has met are people who are loyal to a career just because that is what they decided to major in at 18. Allowing yourself to realize that you are unhappy in a career and being able to move on is essential to being comfortable. “The trick is to accept the reality of change and move on as soon as possible.” Sunk cost fallacy is everywhere in our lives. We believe because we have put something in, we have to get something out. This just isn’t the case. You are not guaranteed anything, so you might as well enjoy the process and motions of what you are doing. This slightly contradicts the idea of compounding, or letting things grow. The book really hammers the point of not touching your investments. Investments not just being stocks, but also careers and relationships. He gives a decent explanation of this dichotomy, but really it boils down to finding a middle ground. Maybe this could have been described better, but it is so nuanced that it could probably have a book of its own written about it.
            <br>
            <br>
            And maybe that’s the problem. It isn’t that the book doesn’t describe these points, but that broad strokes are given. I frustrate myself by reading books about psychology, because as you would see in my thoughts on <i>Grit</i>, psychology has no set values or ideas. It is a science of ebb and flow. If you say something is true, someone could find multiple examples of it being false. I mean, on the very last page there is a legal notice that Housel or the publisher is not liable if the advice given doesn’t work. I understand that everyone has to cover themselves, but it feels like they themselves don’t believe in it fully; they realize that everything could be different in the future (which funny enough is a chapter in the book). Now don’t let this come across as a bash on the thoughts of the book, for the most part, I feel that they are very sound. It would just be nice to see a discussion on the point of - this book is not infallible. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m looking through all of my notes I took on this book, and I am struggling to put together a way to condense all of the final wisdom into just a few paragraphs. So, I am not even going to try. What I will say about the book is this: there are those who are satisfied and those who are not. Morgan Housel describes strategies that would help take someone from the unsatisfied category and help them achieve the latter. Avoiding extreme ends of financial planning, being too frugal or too risky, is key to success. “Wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent.” There are many people who look wealthy but are so leveraged that all of their time is already sold. This is not where you want to be; you want control over your time and life. Just don’t look at this book as a guide to making money. It really is a book about how to keep the money you already have (or will have). I feel it's a good 4.3/5. I recommend it, and I hope to see another publication by Housel in the future.

            <p> A very short, but great, read. If you haven’t watched the University of Texas at Austin 2014 Commencement Address, please make sure to do so. I remember watching this in high school, and at the time didn’t think too much of it. But just this last year, I watched it again with a group of people, and this time it sank a little deeper. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The book is simply 10 rules for life. In the book, he gives a bit more detail about each of the rules, but in the most concise way possible. Each of his stories are only a couple pages long. Just long enough to give a great picture without bogging down in details. He describes the hardships and successes of his SEAL time, and it comes across as a very genuine love for what he does. In a lot of stories and books about the SEALs (looking at you Goggins) there is a whole lot of detail about just how miserable and hard training is. I don’t blame them; if you are willing to go through SEAL training, you can say whatever you want. Admiral McRaven’s approach, though, is precise. He tells the story without embellishment, and it just reads and feels like he really just wants you to know how each of the rules can be applied. It isn’t about how cool of a war hero he was; it is about making everyone better.
            <br>
            <br>
            The book can be read easily in an afternoon, and so I am going to keep this one short. 5/5, you can’t beat good, easy reads.

                </div>
            
            <p>11/11/2022</p>
            <p>I will admit that this book was a grind to get through, but you shouldn’t have it any other way. The book is not easy to read, and there are a lot of terms and names thrown around constantly. Not every line is profound, in fact, most pages are not profound, but as you continue to push, you feel the genius in what he is describing. In a way it feels like I shouldn’t even try to describe the book, because I know I am going to butcher the ideas he is trying to get across. So, take all of this with a grain of salt, as I try to describe all the notes I took. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In the first half, Alan Watts describes the background and history of Zen. With this comes lots of names and terms that we just are never really exposed to in Western thought. Sprinkled in with the history, are ideas that sprung up between the different Zen, Tao, and Buddhist thoughts. Some of the most intriguing I came across was, firstly, the idea of just going with the wind. What is described as a very Western thought are “perfect states”. We think of items, places, people at their most perfect state, and we are constantly seeking this. Watts describes letting go of this and allowing ourselves to not fight change and to see the beauty in what comes next. This leads to a later problem described as the “Western double-binds”. Worry about worrying which leads to more worry. An infinite loop that leads to no good outcomes. In the second half of the book, on teachings, it is thought that you should commit to and move forward. The double-bind can be broken by just choosing a path. Nothing will be perfect, so why try? Move onto what makes you satisfied and pursue. The trick is, you can’t look back once you start. Once you have chosen a path, you must push forward. You are allowed to reflect on what you have chosen, but you cannot reflect on reflecting. This creates worry which leads to the bind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The second idea I’ve thought about a lot since starting the book, you don’t have to justify your life. Western thought demeans those who are “wasting time”. I will admit that in more modern times, and in most self-help books, meditation is a growing trend. Many people prescribe some sort of meditation. This meditation usually is a five minute routine sitting on the floor thinking about and planning your day. I don’t think Watts would argue that this isn’t a form of meditation, but I think he would say this isn’t really what it was meant for. I think he would also say that we still despise those who are wasteful with time. Meditation is allowing yourself to be justified in what you are doing. Because you were born, because you are alive, you are justified. You do not have to fulfill every dream or be unbelievably successful to be justified. You only have to be. “To the Taoist mentality, the aimless empty life does not suggest anything depressing. On the contrary, it suggests the freedom of clouds and mountain streams, wandering nowhere, of flowers in impenetrable canyons, beautiful for no one to see, and of surf forever washing the sand, to no end.” A very difficult idea to swallow. How could no aim, no meaning, lead to anything good? This finally leads to the ideas of satisfaction duality. What is good is only good in relation to what is bad. A quiet empty life compared to one of pain and insatisfaction. It can be thought of as “the higher you are, the harder you fall.” Allowing yourself the freedom to just move with the wind and be free, can lead to a great fulfilment. 
            <br>
            <br>
            None of this is to say you should do nothing. This is not the point at all. Meditation and fulfillment are usually seen as sitting on a mountain side, cross legged, for years on end, but meditation is whatever you make it. If you enjoy your work, your hobbies, family, all of this is meditation - allowing yourself to just be: justified. Allow yourself to enjoy what you do, even if you don’t feel like it is beneficial to society. “Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone,” allow yourself to not stir on indecision and become anxious. Be calm and enjoy the process. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, this is an idea that I am not quite sure on, so you may want to take this with extra grains of salt. I couldn’t quite figure out if everyone is Buddha or anyone can become Buddha. “Those who do know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.” By calling yourself Buddha you have broken the idea of Buddha. Being silent and being allows you to be Buddha. This is a common theme of the book, not allowing yourself to seek but allow yourself to ride the waves. There is no past or future, and the present is self-contained and quiescent. “The flowers depart when we hate to lose them; the weeds arrive while we hate to watch them grow.” In the moments that come, there will be good and bad times, but in those moments remembering your justification and allowing yourself to move with the flow of space. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Trying to surmise the book in a single paragraph would be impossible. Just as there are so many schools of thought in Christianity, so are there in Eastern thought. In this, there is a thought that took me the most. Zen is not about being impulsive and lacking in morality and reflection. Zen is the elimination of blocking of thought and action. Indecision is the killer of fulfillment. Indecision leads to anxiety, but “what comes through the gate is not family treasure.” Much of Zen must be learned on your own. You can’t be told what Zen is; you must live it. I don’t feel like giving this book a rating, but I am glad I found it. In the final pages of the book, Alan Watts reminds, “It’s just this, and nothing else,” so why worry?

            <p>10/6/2022</p>
            <p>Growing up, I had three celebrity crushes: Selena Gomez, Ellie Goulding, and Jennette McCurdy. I remember feeling sad, growing up, knowing that they were just too old for me. I mean, what 18-year-old would go out with a 12-year-old? But this did not stop me from watching way too many hours of iCarly. We didn’t get “high-speed” internet until I was a bit older, so I was never able to go to the iCarly website during its peak (if you go there now it just takes you to the Nickelodeon page). It took a long time to get over this sadness, so you can imagine my happiness when Paramount announced they would be streaming it. Plus, they were going to be revitalizing the show. I have yet to go back and watch any of it (Jennette McCurdy doesn’t come back to the show, which is discussed in the book), but it did remind me of my old crush.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have listened to Jennette McCurdy’s podcast, <i>Empty Inside</i>, on and off since its inception. I was excited to see she had a book coming out, and after finishing Grit, I was ready for a completely different style of writing. This book took me for a ride. Call it cheesy, cringey, or whatever, but this book feels special. Written in a tone that makes you feel like you're reading her personal journal, it feels loose but so articulated at the same time. It doesn’t feel held back, but a lot of these kinds of memoirs seem to be so full of cussing and overly explicit content, that it makes it feel disingenuous. This is most definitely not the case here. The first curse word was used almost half way into the book, and this directly coincided with the transition from ‘active’ Mormon to ‘inactive’. It’s such a subtle but strong indicator in how her life and relationships are moving forward. It may be a silly example, but this book is just full of these shifts that you can just immediately feel, but without the writing really changing. This really is a read-to-understand explanation, so I apologize for that. But man, here I am writing about this book a few days later, and I’m still just as stunned as I was when I read the last sentence.
            <br>
            <br>
            Maybe that last paragraph didn’t make much sense, but the bottom line is this is a must read. This book, though, did not make me feel good. The title, <i>I’m Glad My Mom Died</i>, is shocking, but it captures the soul and essence in five words. In the end she concludes with discussions on how she is making strides forward, but you are left with this feeling that it will never be easy. This book creates this aura of personal reflection; you think about your own life and how true it is for everyone’s struggles. There is no peppy talk or high-fives, it is all just work. Even without living her life, you are just so easily able to superimpose the feelings of the book onto your own thoughts.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started this ‘book club’ to remind myself of the books I’ve read, and maybe so I can remember how they made me feel. This book doesn’t require this, I had to force myself to not just start on page 1 again right after finishing. This book is so powerful, in fact, that it kind of left a void in my reading log. It’s almost like I need a week or two without reading to fully digest and think about what I just read. Kudos to Ms. McCurdy on this achievement, because man oh man I cannot stop thinking about it. Easy 5/5, I couldn’t even begin to critique this book. I was left with no questions and was just genuinely enthralled throughout its entirety.

            <p>09/26/2022</p>
            <p>	After finishing <i>Can’t Hurt Me</i> again, I did some reflecting on other books I would like to reread. I have no idea what the real number is, but if I had to take a guess, you only really remember 1-2% of what you read (or maybe I’m just not very smart). This is what made me want to pick up Grit again. This book is oh-so jam packed with advice and information, and it is sad to think that after reading it twice, I probably still only took in 3%. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I will get it out of the way, this book is not a “fun” read. You don’t ever really feel like going out and doing ultramarathons or climbing Everest; in fact, I would say it's definitely a snoozer. What it lacks in pazaz it makes up whole heartedly with real life advice. It does not feel sugar coated or sing-songy. It describes grit for what it really is - grit. Perseverance in life through thoughtful action, seeing through your end goals, doing the things today that you know you should be doing. Over and over again Dr. Duckworth shows you that no matter how talented you are, without putting in hard work, day in and day out, you will not succeed. She explains so many different life stages and what grit looks like for them, and everything is backed up by real research. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The problem, it is overwhelming with research. You very much understand that she is smart and has a lot to say, but it comes across as fire hydrant information. This is coupled by the fact that psychology has zero absolutes to it. I have a hard time with this, I know I know, there is nuance to everything, but all nuances don’t need to be discussed. I do think the book either needed to be condensed - fewer topics, or expanded - slower pace with more info per topic. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a 4.4/5 read. I will tell you now that if you don’t like ‘academically sounding’ books, you will hate it. You have to be ready to grit your way through it (I made myself chuckle), but I promise once finished, you’ll be so happy you did.

                </div>
            
            <p>08/11/2022</p>
            <p>	At this point if you haven’t read the book, what are you doing? I know what you’re thinking when you hear Goggins, “oh no another one of those cringe Joe-Rogan-DMT-log-carrying-boat boys.” I know, because I think the same way. Once you get past the hype, it truly is incredible what he accomplished. This is a rare book for me in that this is actually my third time reading it. It only gets better each time I’ve read it, and you can’t help but feel at least slightly inspired to try harder. Whenever I start to feel lazy, I read the book to get me back on the horse. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is no such thing as a perfect book, and this is not an exception. I think that if you worship this book, you’re kind of a dummy. The part that kills me is that he says multiple times that his lifestyle basically sucks, and then people go out and try to imitate it. I agree in order to ‘get hard’ you have to do hard things, but to do those things in search of clout - I have yet to see it work out. If you want to imitate Goggins, you can’t just adopt his workouts, but you have to aquire his personality. I think social media is great, and I love to see people’s successes. In fact, I would go as far as to say that I believe people should post more of their successes. Unfortunately when you look at #canthurtme tags, you can’t help but feel the cringe meter tick. For some reason, people love to post that they are going to do 100 days of something, and you only see the first 2 or 3, then it goes dark, never to be seen again. Anybody can do anything for a few days, but it takes grit in order to go the distance (Rocky round 14).
            <br>
            <br>
            That wasn’t a very good critique of the book since it isn’t the book's fault that people try to imitate Goggins. I believe the shortcomings are in the personal life department. I have wondered since the first time I read the book, back in spring 2020, what happened to his child or why he was divorced multiple times. Even if he wants to keep that part of his life private, I do think a statement about protecting their identity would have been good. You can’t claim to have aired all your dirty laundry if there are topics that feel blatantly secret.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that being said, I recommend this book. It is a 4.9/5, and I’ll probably end up reading it again sometime. It feels good knowing there are people out there as passionate and hardworking as Goggins, and I even fall into the trap of thinking I can go run the Moab 240 on Myoplex and Ritz crackers. Maybe that’s why I like the book so much. I think Taylor would be mad at me if I did that, so I think I’ll keep that off to the side for the next while.
