            <p>10/6/2022</p>
            <p>Growing up, I had three celebrity crushes: Selena Gomez, Ellie Goulding, and Jennette McCurdy. I remember feeling sad, growing up, knowing that they were just too old for me. I mean, what 18-year-old would go out with a 12-year-old? But this did not stop me from watching way too many hours of iCarly. We didn’t get “high-speed” internet until I was a bit older, so I was never able to go to the iCarly website during its peak (if you go there now it just takes you to the Nickelodeon page). It took a long time to get over this sadness, so you can imagine my happiness when Paramount announced they would be streaming it. Plus, they were going to be revitalizing the show. I have yet to go back and watch any of it (Jennette McCurdy doesn’t come back to the show, which is discussed in the book), but it did remind me of my old crush.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have listened to Jennette McCurdy’s podcast, <i>Empty Inside</i>, on and off since its inception. I was excited to see she had a book coming out, and after finishing Grit, I was ready for a completely different style of writing. This book took me for a ride. Call it cheesy, cringey, or whatever, but this book feels special. Written in a tone that makes you feel like you're reading her personal journal, it feels loose but so articulated at the same time. It doesn’t feel held back, but a lot of these kinds of memoirs seem to be so full of cussing and overly explicit content, that it makes it feel disingenuous. This is most definitely not the case here. The first curse word was used almost half way into the book, and this directly coincided with the transition from ‘active’ Mormon to ‘inactive’. It’s such a subtle but strong indicator in how her life and relationships are moving forward. It may be a silly example, but this book is just full of these shifts that you can just immediately feel, but without the writing really changing. This really is a read-to-understand explanation, so I apologize for that. But man, here I am writing about this book a few days later, and I’m still just as stunned as I was when I read the last sentence.
            <br>
            <br>
            Maybe that last paragraph didn’t make much sense, but the bottom line is this is a must read. This book, though, did not make me feel good. The title, <i>I’m Glad My Mom Died</i>, is shocking, but it captures the soul and essence in five words. In the end she concludes with discussions on how she is making strides forward, but you are left with this feeling that it will never be easy. This book creates this aura of personal reflection; you think about your own life and how true it is for everyone’s struggles. There is no peppy talk or high-fives, it is all just work. Even without living her life, you are just so easily able to superimpose the feelings of the book onto your own thoughts.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started this ‘book club’ to remind myself of the books I’ve read, and maybe so I can remember how they made me feel. This book doesn’t require this, I had to force myself to not just start on page 1 again right after finishing. This book is so powerful, in fact, that it kind of left a void in my reading log. It’s almost like I need a week or two without reading to fully digest and think about what I just read. Kudos to Ms. McCurdy on this achievement, because man oh man I cannot stop thinking about it. Easy 5/5, I couldn’t even begin to critique this book. I was left with no questions and was just genuinely enthralled throughout its entirety.

            <p>	After finishing <i>Can’t Hurt Me</i> again, I did some reflecting on other books I would like to reread. I have no idea what the real number is, but if I had to take a guess, you only really remember 1-2% of what you read (or maybe I’m just not very smart). This is what made me want to pick up Grit again. This book is oh-so jam packed with advice and information, and it is sad to think that after reading it twice, I probably still only took in 3%. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I will get it out of the way, this book is not a “fun” read. You don’t ever really feel like going out and doing ultramarathons or climbing Everest; in fact, I would say it's definitely a snoozer. What it lacks in pazaz it makes up whole heartedly with real life advice. It does not feel sugar coated or sing-songy. It describes grit for what it really is - grit. Perseverance in life through thoughtful action, seeing through your end goals, doing the things today that you know you should be doing. Over and over again Dr. Duckworth shows you that no matter how talented you are, without putting in hard work, day in and day out, you will not succeed. She explains so many different life stages and what grit looks like for them, and everything is backed up by real research. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The problem, it is overwhelming with research. You very much understand that she is smart and has a lot to say, but it comes across as fire hydrant information. This is coupled by the fact that psychology has zero absolutes to it. I have a hard time with this, I know I know, there is nuance to everything, but all nuances don’t need to be discussed. I do think the book either needed to be condensed - fewer topics, or expanded - slower pace with more info per topic. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a 4.4/5 read. I will tell you now that if you don’t like ‘academically sounding’ books, you will hate it. You have to be ready to grit your way through it (I made myself chuckle), but I promise once finished, you’ll be so happy you did.

        <!--Can't Hurt Me-->
        <button type="button" class="collapsibleBC"><i>Can’t Hurt Me</i> - David Goggins</button>
            <div class="contentBC">

                <div class="JE_img_wrap" style="border: None; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <img src="../images/CHM_Cover.jpg" alt="Can't Hurt Me - David Goggins, Cover">
                </div>
            
            <p>08/11/2022</p>
            <p>	At this point if you haven’t read the book, what are you doing? I know what you’re thinking when you hear Goggins, “oh no another one of those cringe Joe-Rogan-DMT-log-carrying-boat boys.” I know, because I think the same way. Once you get past the hype, it truly is incredible what he accomplished. This is a rare book for me in that this is actually my third time reading it. It only gets better each time I’ve read it, and you can’t help but feel at least slightly inspired to try harder. Whenever I start to feel lazy, I read the book to get me back on the horse. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is no such thing as a perfect book, and this is not an exception. I think that if you worship this book, you’re kind of a dummy. The part that kills me is that he says multiple times that his lifestyle basically sucks, and then people go out and try to imitate it. I agree in order to ‘get hard’ you have to do hard things, but to do those things in search of clout - I have yet to see it work out. If you want to imitate Goggins, you can’t just adopt his workouts, but you have to aquire his personality. I think social media is great, and I love to see people’s successes. In fact, I would go as far as to say that I believe people should post more of their successes. Unfortunately when you look at #canthurtme tags, you can’t help but feel the cringe meter tick. For some reason, people love to post that they are going to do 100 days of something, and you only see the first 2 or 3, then it goes dark, never to be seen again. Anybody can do anything for a few days, but it takes grit in order to go the distance (Rocky round 14).
            <br>
            <br>
            That wasn’t a very good critique of the book since it isn’t the book's fault that people try to imitate Goggins. I believe the shortcomings are in the personal life department. I have wondered since the first time I read the book, back in spring 2020, what happened to his child or why he was divorced multiple times. Even if he wants to keep that part of his life private, I do think a statement about protecting their identity would have been good. You can’t claim to have aired all your dirty laundry if there are topics that feel blatantly secret.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that being said, I recommend this book. It is a 4.9/5, and I’ll probably end up reading it again sometime. It feels good knowing there are people out there as passionate and hardworking as Goggins, and I even fall into the trap of thinking I can go run the Moab 240 on Myoplex and Ritz crackers. Maybe that’s why I like the book so much. I think Taylor would be mad at me if I did that, so I think I’ll keep that off to the side for the next while.
